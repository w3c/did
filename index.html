    <p>
<a>Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A <a>DID</a> identifies any
subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)
that the controller of the <a>DID</a> decides that it identifies. In contrast to
typical, federated identifiers, <a>DIDs</a> have been designed so that they may be
decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate
authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the
discovery of information related to a <a>DID</a>, the design enables the
controller of a <a>DID</a> to prove control over it without requiring permission
from any other party. <a>DIDs</a> are <a>URIs</a> that associate a <a>DID subject</a>
with a <a>DID document</a> allowing trustable interactions associated with that
subject.
    </p>
    <p>
Each <a>DID document</a> can express cryptographic material, <a>verification
methods</a>, or <a>services</a>, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling
a <a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the <a>DID</a>. <a>Services</a>
enable trusted interactions associated with the <a>DID subject</a>. A
<a>DID</a> might provide the means to return the <a>DID subject</a> itself,
if the <a>DID subject</a> is an information resource such as a data model.
    </p>
    <p>
This document specifies a common data model, a URL format, and a set of
operations for <a>DIDs</a>, <a>DID documents</a>, and <a>DID methods</a>.

  <section class="informative">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
As individuals and organizations, many of us use globally unique identifiers in
a wide variety of contexts. They serve as communications addresses (telephone
numbers, email addresses, usernames on social media), ID numbers (for passports,
drivers licenses, tax IDs, health insurance), and product identifiers (serial
numbers, barcodes, RFIDs). Resources on the Internet are identified by globally
unique identifiers in the form of <abbr title="Media Access Control">MAC</abbr>
addresses; URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) are used for resources on the Web
and each web page you view in a browser has a globally unique URL (Uniform
Resource Locator).
    </p>
    <p>
The vast majority of these globally unique identifiers are not under our
control. They are issued by external authorities that decide who or what they
identify and when they can be revoked. They are useful only in certain contexts
and recognized only by certain bodies (not of our choosing). They may disappear
or cease to be valid with the failure of an organization. They may unnecessarily
reveal personal information. And in many cases they can be fraudulently
replicated and asserted by a malicious third-party ("identity theft").
    </p>
    <p>
The Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) defined in this specification are a new
type of globally unique identifier designed to enable individuals and
organizations to generate our own identifiers using systems we trust, and to
prove control of those identifiers (authenticate) using cryptographic proofs
(for example, digital signatures).
    </p>
    <p>
Because we control the generation and assertion of these identifiers, each of us
can have as many DIDs as we need to respect our desired separation of
identities, personas, and contexts (in the everyday sense of these words). We
can scope the use of these identifiers to the most appropriate contexts. We can
interact with other people, institutions or systems that require us to identify
ourselves (or things we control) while maintaining control over how much
personal or private data should be revealed, and without depending on a central
authority to guarantee the continued existence of the identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
This specification does not presuppose any particular technology or
cryptography to underpin the generation, persistence, resolution or
interpretation of DIDs. Rather, it defines: a) the generic syntax for all
DIDs, and b) the generic requirements for performing the four basic CRUD
operations (create, read, update, deactivate) on the information associated
with a DID (called the DID document).
    </p>
    <p>
This enables implementers to design specific types of DIDs to work with the
computing infrastructure they trust (e.g., distributed ledger, decentralized
file system, distributed database, peer-to-peer network). The specification
for a specific type of DID is called a DID method. Implementers of
applications or systems using DIDs can choose to support the DID methods most
appropriate for their particular use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
This specification is for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
Developers who want to enable users of their system to generate and assert their
own identifiers (producers of DIDs);
      </li>
      <li>
Developers who want to enable their systems to accept user-controlled
identifiers (consumers of DIDs);
      </li>
      <li>
Developers who wish to enable the use of DIDs with particular computing
infrastructure (DID method developers).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note" title="Diversity of DID systems">
DID methods can also be developed for identifiers registered in federated or
centralized identity management systems. Indeed, almost all types of identifier
systems can add support for DIDs. This creates an interoperability bridge
between the worlds of centralized, federated, and decentralized identifiers.
    </p>

      <h2>A Simple Example</h2>

      <p>
A <a>DID</a> is a simple text string consisting of three parts, the:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
URI scheme identifier (<code>did</code>)
          </li>
          <li>
Identifier for the <a>DID method</a>
          </li>
          <li>
DID method-specific identifier.
          </li>
        </ul>

The example <a>DID</a> above resolves to a <a>DID document</a>. A <a>DID
document</a> contains information associated with the <a>DID</a>, such as ways
to cryptographically <a>authenticate</a> the <a>DID controller</a>, as
well as <a>services</a> that can be used to interact with the <a>DID subject</a>.

      </figure>

      <dl>
        <dt>
DIDs and DID URLs
        </dt>
        <dd>
A <a>DID</a>, or Decentralized Identifier, is a <a>URI</a> composed of three parts: the
scheme "did:", a method identifier, and a unique, method-specific identifier
generated by the <a>DID method</a>. <a>DIDs</a> are resolvable to <a>DID documents</a>.
A <a>DID URL</a> extends the syntax of a basic <a>DID</a> to incorporate other standard
<a>URI</a> components (path, query, fragment) in order to locate a particular
<a>resource</a>&mdash;for example, a public key inside a <a>DID document</a>, or a
<a>resource</a> available external to the <a>DID document</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID Subjects
        </dt>
        <dd>
The subject of a <a>DID</a> is, by definition, the entity identified by the
<a>DID</a>. The <a>DID subject</a> may also be the <a>DID controller</a>.
Anything can be the subject of a <a>DID</a>: person, group, organization, physical
thing, logical thing, etc.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID Controllers
        </dt>
        <dd>
The <a>controller</a> of a <a>DID</a> is the entity (person, organization, or
autonomous software) that has the capability&mdash;as defined by a <a>DID
method</a>&mdash;to make changes to a <a>DID document</a>. This capability is
typically asserted by the control of a set of cryptographic keys used by
software acting on behalf of the controller, though it may also be asserted via
other mechanisms. Note that a <a>DID</a> may have more than one controller, and the
<a>DID subject</a> can be the <a>DID controller</a>, or one of them.
        </dd>

        <dt>
Verifiable Data Registries
        </dt>
        <dd>
In order to be resolvable to <a>DID documents</a>, <a>DIDs</a> are typically
recorded on an underlying system or network of some kind. Regardless of the
specific technology used, any such system that supports recording <a>DIDs</a> and
returning data necessary to produce <a>DID documents</a> is called a
<a>verifiable data registry</a>. Examples include <a>distributed ledgers</a>,
decentralized file systems, databases of any kind, peer-to-peer networks, and
other forms of trusted data storage.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID documents
        </dt>
        <dd>
<a>DID documents</a> contain information associated with a <a>DID</a>. They
typically express <a>verification methods</a> (such as public keys) and <a>services</a>
relevant to interactions with the <a>DID subject</a>. A <a>DID document</a> can be serialized
according to a particular syntax (see Section <a href="#representations"></a>). The
generic properties supported in a <a>DID document</a> are specified in <a
href="#core-properties"></a>. The <a>DID</a> itself is the value of the `id`
property. The properties present in a <a>DID document</a> may be updated according to
the applicable operations outlined in <a href="#methods"></a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID Methods
        </dt>
        <dd>
<a>DID methods</a> are the mechanism by which a particular type of <a>DID</a>
and its associated <a>DID document</a> are created, resolved, updated, and
deactivated using a particular <a>verifiable data registry</a>. <a>DID
methods</a> are defined using separate DID method specifications (see
<a href="#methods"></a>).

          <p class="note">
Conceptually, the relationship between this specification and a <a>DID
method</a> specification is similar to the relationship between the IETF generic
<a>URI</a> specification ([[RFC3986]]) and a specific <a>URI</a> scheme
([[IANA-URI-SCHEMES]] (such as the http: and https: schemes specified in
[[RFC7230]]). It is also similar to the relationship between the IETF generic
URN specification ([[RFC8141]]) and a specific URN namespace definition (such
as the <a>UUID</a> URN namespace defined in [[RFC4122]]). The difference is that
a DID method specification, as well as defining a specific <a>DID scheme</a>, also

This document contains examples that contain JSON, CBOR, and JSON-LD content.
Some of these examples contain characters that are invalid, such as inline
comments (<code>//</code>) and the use of ellipsis (<code>...</code>) to denote
information that adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to
remove this content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON, CBOR,
or JSON-LD.

      <p>
Some examples contain terms (both property names and values) that are not
defined in this specification, for illustrative purposes. These are indicated
with a comment (<code>// external (property name|value)</code>). Such terms,
when used in a <a>DID document</a>, are expected to be registered in the DID

Interoperability of implementations for <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> will be tested by
evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse <a>DIDs</a> and
<a>DID documents</a> that conform to the specification. Interoperability for
producers and consumers of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> is provided by
ensuring the <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> conform. Interoperability for
<a>DID method</a> specifications is provided by the details in each <a>DID method</a>
specification. It is understood that, in the same way that a web browser is not
required to implement all known <a>URI</a> schemes, conformant software that works with
<a>DIDs</a> is not required to implement all known <a>DID methods</a> (however, all
implementations of a given <a>DID method</a> must be interoperable for that method).

In addition to the terminology above, this specification also uses terminology
from the [[INFRA]] specification to formally define the <a

<a data-cite="INFRA#strings">string</a>, <a

    <h2>Identifier</h2>
    <p>
This section describes the formal syntax for <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID URLs</a>. The term
"generic" is used to differentiate the syntax defined here from syntax defined
by <em>specific</em> <a>DID methods</a> in their respective specifications.
    </p>

    <section class="normative">
      <h3>DID Syntax</h3>

      <p>
The generic <a>DID scheme</a> is a <a>URI</a> scheme conformant with [[!RFC3986]].
      </p>

      <p>
The <a>DID scheme</a> name MUST be an
<a data-lt="ascii lowercase">ASCII lowercase string</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
The <a>DID method</a> name MUST be a string which consists of
<a data-lt="ascii lower alpha">ASCII lowercase characters</a> and
<a data-lt="ascii digit">ASCII digits</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
The following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [[!RFC5234]], which
defines <code>ALPHA</code> and <code>DIGIT</code>. All other rule names not
defined in this ABNF are defined in [[RFC3986]].
      </p>

      <pre class="nohighlight">
did                = "did:" method-name ":" method-specific-id

method-char        = %x61-7A / DIGIT
method-specific-id = *( *idchar ":" ) 1*idchar
idchar             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_"
      </pre>

      <p class="issue atrisk" data-number="34">
This ABNF does not currently permit an empty <code>method-specific-id</code>
string. Some DID methods have expressed an interest in providing
resolution of an DID with an empty <code>method-specific-id</code> string,
for example to enable discovery of a DID document describing a
<a>verifiable data registry</a> by resolving the DID method name alone.
The Working Group is requesting feedback during the Candidate Recommendation
stage on whether or not an empty <code>method-specific-id</code> string is
of interest to implementers. This feature may change as a result of that feedback.

    <section class="normative">
      <h3>DID URL Syntax</h3>

      <p>
A <a>DID URL</a> always identifies a <a>resource</a> to be located. It can be
used, for example, to identify a specific part of a <a>DID document</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
This following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [[!RFC5234]]. It
builds on the <code>did</code> scheme defined in <a href="#did-syntax"></a>. The
<a data-cite="!rfc3986#section-3.3"><code>path-abempty</code></a>,
<a data-cite="!rfc3986#section-3.4"><code>query</code></a>, and

      <section>
        <h2>DID Parameters</h2>

        <p>
The <a>DID URL</a> syntax supports a simple format for parameters
based on the <code>query</code> component (See <a href="#query"></a>). Adding
a DID parameter to a <a>DID URL</a> means that the parameter becomes part of
the identifier for a <a>resource</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
Some DID parameters are completely independent of of any specific <a>DID
method</a>, and function the same way for all <a>DIDs</a>. Other DID
parameters are not necessarily supported by all <a>DID methods</a>. Where
optional parameters are supported, they are expected to operate uniformly
across the <a>DID methods</a> that do support them. Requirements which enable
this are detailed in the following table.
        </p>

        <p>
Implementers as well as <a>DID method</a> specification authors might use
additional DID parameters that are not listed here. For maximum
interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that DID parameters use the official W3C
DID Specification Registries mechanism [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]], to avoid
collision with other uses of the same DID parameter with different semantics.
        </p>

        <p>
DID parameters might be used if there is a clear use case where the parameter
needs to be part of a <a>URI</a> that can be used as a link, or as a <a>resource</a>
in RDF / JSON-LD documents.
        </p>

        <p>
It is expected that DID parameters will <em>not</em> be used if the same
functionality can be expressed by passing input metadata to a <a>DID resolver</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
Additional considerations for processing these parameters are discussed in
[[?DID-RESOLUTION]].
        </p>

        <p>
Some example <a>DID URLs</a> using DID parameters are shown below.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="A DID URL with a 'service' DID parameter">

did:foo:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?versionTime=2002-10-10T17:00:00Z
        </pre>

        <p class="note" title="DID parameters and DID resolution">
The <a>DID resolution</a> and the <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> functions can
be influenced by passing input metadata to a <a>DID resolver</a> that are
not part of the <a>DID URL</a>. (See <a
href="#did-resolution-input-metadata-properties"></a>). This is comparable to
HTTP, where certain parameters could either be included in an HTTP URL, or
alternatively passed as HTTP headers during the dereferencing process. The
important distinction is that DID parameters that are part of the <a>DID
URL</a> should be used to specify <em>what <a>resource</a> is being
identified</em>, whereas input metadata that is not part of the <a>DID URL</a>
should be use to control <em>how that <a>resource</a> is resolved or
dereferenced</em>.

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Path</h2>

        <p>
A <a>DID path</a> is identical to a generic <a>URI</a> path and MUST conform to the
<a data-cite="!rfc3986#section-3.3"><code>path-abempty</code></a> ABNF rule in
[[!RFC3986]].
        </p>

        <p>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID paths</a>
that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight">

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Query</h2>

        <p>
A <a>DID query</a> is derived from a generic <a>URI</a> query and MUST conform to the
<code>did-query</code> ABNF rule in Section <a href="#did-url-syntax">
</a>. If a <a>DID query</a> is present, it MUST be used
as described in Section <a href="#did-parameters"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID queries</a>
that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight">

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Fragment</h2>

        <p>
A <a>DID fragment</a> is used as method-independent reference into a <a>DID
document</a> or external <a>resource</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>DID fragment</a> syntax and semantics are identical to a generic <a>URI</a>
fragment and MUST conform to <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-3.5">RFC&nbsp;3986,
section 3.5</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
For information about how to dereference a <a>DID fragment</a>, see
<a href="#did-url-dereferencing"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID
fragments</a> that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
        </p>

        <p>
In order to maximize interoperability, implementers are urged to ensure that
<a>DID fragments</a> are interpreted in the same way across <a>representations</a> (as
described in Section <a href="#representations"></a>). For example, while
JSON Pointer [[?RFC6901]] can be used in a <a>DID fragment</a>, it will not
be interpreted in the same way across <a>representations</a>.
        </p>

        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A unique <a>verification method</a> in a <a>DID Document</a>
            <pre class="example nohighlight">did:example:123#public-key-0</pre>
          </li>

          <li>A unique <a>service</a> in a <a>DID Document</a>
            <pre class="example nohighlight">did:example:123#agent</pre>
          </li>

          <li>A <a>resource</a> external to a <a>DID Document</a>
            <pre class="example nohighlight">did:example:123?service=agent&relativeRef=/credentials#degree</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
Additional semantics for fragment identifiers, which are compatible with and
layered upon the semantics in this section, are described for JSON-LD
representations in Section <a href="#application-did-ld-json"></a>.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Relative DID URLs</h2>

        <p>
A relative <a>DID URL</a> is any URL value in a <a>DID document</a> that does not start
with <code>did:&lt;method-name>:&lt;method-specific-id></code>. More
specifically, it is any URL value that does not start with the ABNF defined  in
Section <a href="#did-syntax"></a>. The contents of the URL typically
refers to a <a>resource</a> in the same <a>DID document</a>. Relative <a>DID URLs</a>
MAY contain relative path components, query parameters, and fragment
identifiers.
        </p>

        <p>
When resolving a relative <a>DID URL</a> reference, the algorithm specified in <a
data-cite="RFC3986#section-5">RFC3986 Section 5: Reference Resolution</a> MUST
be used. The <strong>base URI</strong> value is the <a>DID</a> that is
associated with the <a>DID subject</a>, see Section <a href="#did-subject"></a>.
The <strong>scheme</strong> is <code>did</code>. The <strong>authority</strong>
is a combination of <code>&lt;method-name>:&lt;method-specific-id></code>, and
the <strong>path</strong>, <strong>query</strong>, and <strong>fragment</strong>
values are those defined in Section <a href="#path"></a>, Section <a
href="#query"></a>, and Section <a href="#fragment"></a>, respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
Relative <a>DID URLs</a> are often used to identify <a>verification methods</a> and
<a>services</a> in a <a>DID Document</a> without having to use absolute URLs, which
tend to be more verbose than necessary.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="An example of a relative DID URL">
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",

}
        </pre>

        <p>
In the example above, the relative <a>DID URL</a> value will be transformed to an
absolute <a>DID URL</a> value of <code>did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1</code>.

    <h1>Data Model</h1>
    <p>
This specification defines a data model for <a>DID documents</a> that
is capable of being serialized into multiple concrete <a>representations</a>. This
section provides a high-level description of the data model, how different types
of properties are expressed in the data model, and instructions for extending
the data model.
    </p>
    <p>
A <a>DID document</a> consists of a <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a> of <a
data-cite="INFRA#map-entry">entries</a>, where each entry consists of
an entry key/entry value pair. The data model contains at least two
different classes of entries. The first class of entries are called
properties, and are specified in section <a href="#core-properties"></a>.
The second class are representation-specific entries, and
are specified in section <a href="#representations"></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
All entry keys in the data model are <a
data-cite="INFRA#strings">strings</a>. All entry values are expressed
using one of the abstract data types in the table below while each

      <h2>Extensibility</h2>
      <p>
The data model supports two types of extensibility.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
For maximum interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that extensions use the official
W3C DID Specification Registries mechanism [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. The use of
this mechanism for new properties or other extensions is the only specified
method that ensures that two different <a>representations</a> will be able to work
together.
        </li>
      <li>
<a>Representations</a> MAY define other extensibility mechanisms, including ones that
do not require the use of the DID Specification Registries. Such extension
mechanisms SHOULD support lossless conversion into any other conformant
<a>representation</a>. Extension mechanisms for a <a>representation</a> SHOULD define a
mapping of all properties and <a>representation</a> syntax into the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> and its type system.
      </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note">
It is always possible for two specific implementations to agree out-of-band to
use a mutually understood extension or <a>representation</a> that is not recorded in
the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]; interoperability between such
implementations and the larger ecosystem will be less reliable.

    <h1>Core Properties</h1>

    <p>
A <a>DID</a> points to a <a>DID document</a>. <a>DID documents</a> are the
serialization of the <a href="#data-model">data model</a>.
The following sections define the properties in a <a>DID document</a>,
including whether these properties are required or optional. These properties
describe relationships between the <a>DID subject</a> and the value of the
property.
    </p>

    <p>
This specification defines three classes of core properties:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
properties defined for a <a>DID Document</a>, the topmost
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> in the <a href="#data-model">data
model</a>;
      </li>
      <li>
properties defined for a <a>Verification Method</a>, a concept
represented by a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> in the
<a href="#data-model">data model</a>, and specified in
Section <a href="#verification-methods"></a>;
      </li>
      <li>
properties defined for a <a>Service</a>, a concept
represented by a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> in the
<a href="#data-model">data model</a>, and specified in Section
<a href="#services"></a>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
The core properties are summarized informatively in Section
<a href="#summary"></a>, and described in detail and specified
normatively in subsequent sections.
    </p>


    <p class="note" title="Ordering of values">
As a result of the <a href="#data-model">data model</a> being defined using
terminology from [[INFRA]], property values which can contain more than one
item, such as <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">maps</a> and
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">sets</a>, are explicitly ordered. For the
purposes of this specification, unless otherwise stated, ordering is not
important and implementations are not expected to produce or consume
deterministically ordered values.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>
This section contains an informative reference for the core properties defined
by this specification, with expected values and whether or not they are
required. The property names in the tables are linked to the normative
definitions and more detailed descriptions of each property.
      </p>
      <p class="note" title="Property names used in multiple classes">
  The property names <code>id</code>, <code>type</code>, and
  <code>controller</code> can be present in different classes with possible
  differences in constraints.

        <h3>Also Known As</h3>

        <p>
A <a>DID subject</a> can have multiple identifiers for different purposes, or
at different times. The assertion that two or more <a>DIDs</a> (or other types
of <a>URI</a>) identify the same <a>DID subject</a> can be made using the
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> property.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>alsoKnownAs</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>alsoKnownAs</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST
be an <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">ordered set</a> where each item in the
set is a <a>URI</a> conforming to [[RFC3986]].
          </dd>
          <dd>
This relationship is a statement that the subject of this identifier is
also identified by one or more other identifiers.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <div class="note" title="Equivalence and alsoKnownAs">
          <p>
Applications might choose to consider two identifiers related by
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> to be equivalent <em>if</em> the
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> relationship is reciprocated in the reverse
direction. It is best practice <em>not</em> to consider them equivalent in the
absence of this inverse relationship. In other words, the presence of an
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> assertion does not prove that this assertion
is true. Therefore it is strongly advised that a requesting party obtain
independent verification of an <code>alsoKnownAs</code> assertion.
          </p>
          <p>
Given that the <a>DID subject</a> might use different identifiers for different
purposes, an expectation of strong equivalence between the two identifiers, or
merging the graphs of the two corresponding <a>DID documents</a>, is not
necessarily appropriate, <em>even with</em> a reciprocal relationship.

    <section>
     <h2>DID Controller</h2>

      <p>
A <a>DID controller</a> is an entity that is authorized to make changes to
a <a>DID document</a>. The process of authorizing a <a>DID controller</a> is
defined by the <a>DID Method</a>.
      </p>

      <dl>
          <dt><dfn>controller</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>controller</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> or an <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">ordered set</a> of <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">strings</a> that conform to the rules in Section <a
href="#did-syntax"></a>. The corresponding <a>DID document</a>(s) SHOULD
contain <a>verification relationships</a> that explicitly permit the use of
certain <a>verification methods</a> for specific purposes.
          </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
When a <code><a>controller</a></code> property is present in a
<a>DID Document</a>, its value expresses one or more <a>DIDs</a>. Any
<a>verification methods</a> contained in the <a>DID Documents</a> for those
<a>DIDs</a> SHOULD be accepted as authoritative, such that proofs that satisfy
those <a>verification methods</a> are to be considered equivalent to proofs provided
by the <a>DID Subject</a>.
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight"
        title="DID document with a controller property">
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",

  }]
}
      </pre>

      <p class="note" title="Authorization vs authentication">
Note that authorization provided by the value of <code>controller</code> is
separate from authentication (see Section <a href="#authentication"></a>).
This is particularly important for key recovery in the case of cryptographic
key loss, when the subject no longer has access to their keys, or key
compromise, where the <a>DID controller</a>'s trusted third parties need to
override malicious activity by an attacker. See Section
<a href="#security-considerations"></a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Verification Methods</h2>
      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> can express <a>verification methods</a>, such as
cryptographic keys, which can be used to <a>authenticate</a>1 or authorize interactions
with the <a>DID subject</a> or associated parties. The information expressed
often includes globally unambiguous identifiers and public key material, which
can be used to verify digital signatures. For example, a public key can be
used as a <a>verification method</a> with respect to a digital signature; in such
usage, it verifies that the signer possessed the associated private key.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>Verification methods</a> might take many parameters. An example of this is a set
of five cryptographic keys from which any three are required to contribute to
a threshold signature. Methods need not be cryptographic.
      </p>

      <p>
In order to maximize interoperability, support for public keys as
<a>verification methods</a> is restricted: see
<a href="#verification-method-types"></a>. For other types of <a>verification
method</a>, the <a>verification method</a> SHOULD be registered in the DID
Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

        <dt><dfn>verificationMethod</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
The <code>verificationMethod</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the
value MUST be an <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">ordered
set</a> of <a>verification methods</a>, where each <a>verification method</a> is described by
a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>. The <a>verification method</a>
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST include the <code>id</code>,
<code>type</code>, <code>controller</code>, and specific verification method
properties as determined by the value of <code>type</code>, and MAY include
additional properties.
          </p>
          <p>
The value of the <code><a>id</a></code> property for a <a>verification method</a>
MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> that conforms to the rules in
Section <a href="#did-url-syntax"></a>. When more than one <a>verification method</a>
is present, the value of <code><a>verificationMethod</a></code> MUST NOT
contain multiple entries with the same <code>id</code>. If the value of
<code><a>verificationMethod</a></code> contains multiple entries with the same
<code>id</code>, a <a>DID document</a> processor MUST produce an error.
          </p>

          <p>
In the case where a <a>verification method</a> is a public key, the value of the
<code><a>id</a></code> property might be structured as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_key">compound key</a>. This is
especially useful for integrating with existing key management systems and key
formats such as JWK [[RFC7517]]. It is RECOMMENDED that JWK <code>kid</code>
values are set to the public key fingerprint [[RFC7638]]. It is RECOMMENDED
that verification methods that use JWKs to represent their public keys utilize
the value of <code>kid</code> as their fragment identifier. See the first key
in <a href="#example-16-various-verification-method-types"></a>
for an example of a public key with a compound key identifier.
          </p>

          <p>
The value of the <code>type</code> property MUST be exactly one <a>verification
method</a> type. In order to maximize global interoperability, the
<a>verification method</a> type SHOULD be registered in the DID Specification
Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
          </p>
          <p>
The value of the <code>controller</code> property MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> that conforms to the rules in Section <a
href="#did-syntax"></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
The value of the <code>type</code> property MUST be exactly one verification
method type expressed as a <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>. In order to
maximize interoperability, the <a>verification method</a> type SHOULD be
registered in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
          </p>

          <p>
A <a>verification method</a> MUST contain a property to express verification
material. The property used is determined by the value of the
<code>type</code> property. Examples of such properties are
<code><a>publicKeyJwk</a></code> or <code><a>publicKeyBase58</a></code>;
others can be found in the DID Specification Registries
[[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
          </p>

          <p>
A <a>verification method</a> MUST NOT contain multiple verification material
properties for the same material. For example, expressing key material in a
<a>verification method</a> using both <code>publicKeyJwk</code> and
<code>publicKeyBase58</code> at the same time is prohibited.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>publicKeyJwk</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
The <code>publicKeyJwk</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> representing a JSON Web Key that
conforms to [[RFC7517]]. The <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST NOT
contain "d", or any other members of the private information class as
described in <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-8.1.1">Registration
Template</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>publicKeyBase58</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
The <code>publicKeyBase58</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value
MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> representation of a base58btc
encoded public key.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
In the case where a verification method is a public key, the value of the
<code><a>id</a></code> property might contain a
<a href="#fragment">fragment</a>. This is
especially useful for integrating with existing key management systems and key
formats such as JWK [[RFC7517]]. It is RECOMMENDED that verification methods
that use JWKs to represent their public keys use the value of <code>kid</code>
as their fragment identifier. It is RECOMMENDED that JWK <code>kid</code>
values are set to the public key fingerprint [[RFC7638]]. See the first key
in <a href="#example-15-various-verification-method-types"></a>
for an example of a public key with a compound key identifier.

        title="Verification method controller(s) and DID controller(s)">
The semantics of the <code>controller</code> property are the same when the
subject of the relationship is the <a>DID document</a> as when the subject
of the relationship is a <a>verification method</a>, such as a public key. Since a
key (for example) can't control itself, and the key controller cannot be
inferred from the <a>DID document</a>, it is necessary to explicitly express
the identity of the controller of the key. The difference is that the value of
<code>controller</code> for a <a>verification method</a> is <em>not</em> necessarily
a <a>DID controller</a>. <a>DID controller(s)</a> are expressed using the
<code><a>controller</a></code> property at the highest level of the
<a>DID document</a> (the topmost <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> in
the <a href="#data-model">data model</a>); see
<a href="#did-controller"></a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Verification Methods by reference</h3>
        <p>
As well as the <code><a>verificationMethod</a></code> property, <a>verification
methods</a> can be embedded in or referenced from properties associated with
various <a>verification relationships</a> (see
<a href="#verification-relationships"></a>). Referencing <a>verification methods</a>
allows them to be used with more than one <a>verification relationship</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
If the value of a <a>verification method</a> property is a
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>, the <a>verification method</a> has
been embedded and its properties can be accessed directly. However, if the
value is a URL <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>, the <a>verification
method</a> has been included by reference and its properties will need to be
retrieved from elsewhere in the <a>DID document</a> or from another <a>DID
document</a>. This is done by dereferencing the URL and searching the
resulting resource for a <a>verification method</a>
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> with an <code>id</code> property
whose value matches the URL.

        <h3>Verification Method types</h3>

        <p>
A public key can be used as a <a>verification method</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
This specification strives to limit the number of formats for expressing public
key material in a <a>DID document</a> to the fewest possible, to increase the
likelihood of interoperability. The fewer formats that implementers have to
implement, the more likely it will be that they will support all of them. This
approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between ease of implementation
and supporting formats that have historically had broad deployment.
        </p>

        <p>
A suite definition is responsible for specifying the <a>verification method</a>
<code>type</code> and proof <code>type</code>. For example, see
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">JSON Web Signature 2020</a> and
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-ed25519-2018/">Ed25519 Signature
2018</a>. For all registered and supported <a>verification method</a> types
available for <a>DIDs</a>, please see the DID Specification Registries
[[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
        </p>

        <p>
The <a>DID document</a> does not express revoked keys using a <a>verification
relationship</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
If a referenced verification method is not in the <a>DID Document</a> used to
dereference it, then that verification method is considered invalid or revoked.
        </p>
        <p>
Each <a>DID method</a> specification is expected to detail how revocation is
performed and tracked.

      <h2>Verification Relationships</h2>

      <p>
A <a>verification relationship</a> expresses the relationship between the <a>DID
subject</a> and a <a>verification method</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
Different <a>verification relationships</a> enable the associated
<a>verification methods</a> to be used for different purposes. It is up to a
<em>verifier</em> to ascertain the validity of a verification attempt by
checking that the <a>verification method</a> used is contained in the
appropriate <a>verification relationship</a> property of the
<a>DID Document</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
The <a>verification relationship</a> between the <a>DID subject</a> and the
<a>verification method</a> is explicit in the <a>DID document</a>.
<a>Verification methods</a> that are not associated with a particular
<a>verification relationship</a> cannot be used for that <a>verification
relationship</a>. For example, a <a>verification method</a> in the value of
the <code><a>authentication</a></code> property cannot be used to engage in
key agreement protocols with the <a>DID subject</a>&mdash;the value of the
<code><a>keyAgreement</a></code> property needs to be used for that.
      </p>
      <p>
This specification defines several <a>verification relationships</a> below. A
<a>DID document</a> MAY include any of these, or other properties, to express
a specific <a>verification relationship</a>. In order to maximize global
interoperability, any such properties used SHOULD be registered in the DID
Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Authentication</h2>

        <p>
The `authentication` <a>verification relationship</a> is used to specify how the
<a>DID subject</a> is expected to be <a>authenticated</a>, such as for the purposes of
logging into a website.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>authentication</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>authentication</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated
value MUST be an <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">ordered set</a> of one or more
<a>verification methods</a>. Each <a>verification method</a> MAY be embedded or
referenced.
          </dd>

    }
  ],
  <span class="comment">...</span>
}
        </pre>

        <div class="note" title="Uses of authentication">
          <p>
If authentication is established, it is up to the <a>DID method</a> or other
application to decide what to do with that information. A particular <a>DID
method</a> could decide that authenticating as a <a>DID controller</a> is
sufficient to, for example, update or delete the <a>DID document</a>. Another
<a>DID method</a> could require different keys, or a different <a>verification
method</a> entirely, to be presented in order to update or delete the <a>DID
document</a> than that used to <a>authenticate</a>. In other words, what is done
<em>after</em> the authentication check is out of scope for the
<a href="#data-model">data model</a>, but <a>DID methods</a> and applications
are expected to define this themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
This is useful to any <em>authentication verifier</em> that needs
to check to see if an entity that is attempting to <a>authenticate</a> is, in
fact, presenting a valid proof of authentication. When a <em>verifier</em>
receives some data (in some protocol-specific format) that contains a proof
that was made for the purpose of "authentication", and that says that an
entity is identified by the <a>DID</a>, then that <em>verifier</em> checks to
ensure that the proof can be verified using a <a>verification method</a> (e.g.,
public key) listed under <code><a>authentication</a></code> in the
<a>DID Document</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
Note that the <a>verification method</a> indicated by the
<code><a>authentication</a></code> property of a <a>DID document</a> can only
be used to <a>authenticate</a> the <a>DID subject</a>. To <a>authenticate</a>
a different <a>DID controller</a>, the entity associated with the value of
<code>controller</code> (see Section <a href="#did-controller"></a>) needs to
<a>authenticate</a> with its <em>own</em> <a>DID document</a> and attached
<code><a>authentication</a></code> <a>verification relationship</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Assertion</h2>

        <p>
The `assertionMethod` <a>verification relationship</a> is used to specify how
the <a>DID subject</a> is expected to express claims, such as for the purposes
of issuing a Verifiable Credential [[?VC-DATA-MODEL]].
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>assertionMethod</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>assertionMethod</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the
associated value MUST be an <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">ordered set</a> of
one or more <a>verification methods</a>. Each <a>verification method</a> MAY be
embedded or referenced.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
An example of when this property is useful is during the processing of a
<a>verifiable credential</a> by a verifier. During validation, a verifier checks to
see if a <a>verifiable credential</a> has been signed by the <a>DID Subject</a> by
checking that the <a>verification method</a> used to assert the proof is
associated with the <code><a>assertionMethod</a></code> property in the
corresponding <a>DID Document</a>.

      <section>
        <h2>Key Agreement</h2>

        <p>
The `keyAgreement` <a>verification relationship</a> is used to specify how
to encrypt information to the <a>DID subject</a>, such as for the purposes
of establishing a secure communication channel with the recipient.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>keyAgreement</dfn></dt>

The <code>keyAgreement</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated

<a>verification methods</a>. Each <a>verification method</a> MAY be embedded or
referenced.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when encrypting a message
intended for the <a>DID Subject</a>. In this case, the counterparty uses the
public cryptographic key information in the <a>verification method</a>
to wrap a decryption key for the recipient.

        <h2>Capability Invocation</h2>

        <p>
The `capabilityInvocation` <a>verification relationship</a> is used to specify
a <a>verification method</a> that might be used by the <a>DID subject</a> to
invoke a cryptographic capability, such as the authorization to update the
<a>DID Document</a> or the authorization to access an HTTP API.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>capabilityInvocation</dfn></dt>

The <code>capabilityInvocation</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the

embedded or referenced.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when a <a>DID subject</a>
chooses to invoke their capability to start a vehicle through the combined
usage of a <a>verification method</a> and the <code>StartCar</code>
capability. In this example, the vehicle would be the <em>verifier</em> and
would need to verify that the <a>verification method</a> exists in the
<code><a>capabilityInvocation</a></code> property.

The `capabilityDelegation` <a>verification relationship</a> is used to specify
a mechanism that might be used by the <a>DID subject</a> to delegate
a cryptographic capability to another party, such as delegating the
authority to access a specific HTTP API to a subordinate.

      <h2>Services</h2>

      <p>
<a>Services</a> are used in <a>DID documents</a> to express ways of
communicating with the <a>DID subject</a> or associated entities.
A <a>service</a> can be any type of service the <a>DID subject</a> wants
to advertise, including <a>decentralized identity management</a> services
for further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
Revealing public information through <a>services</a> (such as social media
accounts, personal websites, and email addresses) is discouraged. See Section
<a href="#keep-personally-identifiable-information-pii-private"></a> and
<a href="#service-privacy"></a> for additional details.
The information associated with <a>services</a> are often
service-specific. For example, the information associated with an encrypted
messaging service can express how to initiate the encrypted link before
messaging begins.
      </p>

      <p>
Pointers to <a>services</a> are expressed using the <code><a>service</a></code>
property. Each service has its own <code>id</code> and <code>type</code>
properties, as well as a <code><a>serviceEndpoint</a></code> property with a
<a>URI</a> or a set of other properties describing the service.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>service</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
The <code>service</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated
value MUST be an <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">ordered set</a>
of <a>services</a>, where each service is described by a
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>. Each <a>service</a>
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST have <code><a>id</a></code>,
<code>type</code>, and <code><a>serviceEndpoint</a></code> properties, and MAY
include additional properties.
          </p>
          <p>
The value of the <code>id</code> property MUST be a <a>URI</a>
conforming to [[RFC3986]]. The value of <code>service</code> MUST NOT contain
multiple entries with the same <code>id</code>. In this case, a
<a>DID document</a> processor MUST produce an error.
          </p>
          <p>
The value of the <code>type</code> property MUST be a
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> or an
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">ordered set</a> of
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">strings</a>.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn>serviceEndpoint</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
The value of the <code>serviceEndpoint</code> property MUST be a
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>, a <a data-cite="INFRA#string">map</a>,
or an <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">ordered set</a> composed of a one or more
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">strings</a> and/or
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">maps</a>. All <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>
values MUST be valid <a>URIs</a> conforming to [[RFC3986]] and normalized
according to the rules in section 6 of [[RFC3986]] and to any normalization
rules in its applicable <a>URI</a> scheme specification. Extension
specifications for services MAY further restrict the properties associated
with the extension.
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
It is expected that the <a>service</a> protocol is published in an open
standard specification.

    <h1>Representations</h1>

    <p>
All concrete <a>representations</a> of a <a>DID document</a> are serialized using a
deterministic mapping that is able to be unambiguously parsed into the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> defined in this specification. All
serialization methods MUST define rules for the bidirectional translation of a
<a>DID document</a> both into and out of the <a>representation</a> in question. An
implementation MUST NOT convert between <a>representations</a> without first parsing to
a <a href="#data-model">data model</a> (described in Sections <a
href="#data-model"></a> and <a href="#core-properties"></a>); translation
between any two <a>representations</a> is done by parsing the source <a>representation</a>
into the <a href="#data-model">data model</a> and then serializing the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> into the target <a>representation</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
Although syntactic mappings are provided for JSON, JSON-LD, and CBOR here,
applications and services MAY use any other data <a>representation</a> syntax that is
capable of expressing the <a href="#data-model">data model</a>, such as XML or
YAML.
    </p>

    <p>
Producers MUST indicate which <a>representation</a> of a document has been used via a
media type in the document's metadata. Consumers MUST determine the
<a>representation</a> of a <a>DID document</a> via the <code>contentType</code> <a>DID
resolver</a> metadata field (see <a href="#did-resolution"></a>), <em>not</em>
through the content of the <a>DID document</a> alone.
    </p>

    <p>
Unrecognized entries in the <a href="#data-model">data model</a> MUST be
preserved. An unrecognized entry is any entry that does not have explicit
processing rules known to the consumer or producer. Consumers MUST add all
entries that do not have explicit processing rules for the
<a>representation</a> being consumed to the <a href="#data-model">data
model</a> using only the <a>representation</a>'s generic type processing rules.
Producers MUST serialize all entries in the <a href="#data-model">data
model</a> that do not have explicit processing rules for the
<a>representation</a> being produced using only the <a>representation</a>'s
generic type processing rules.
    </p>

    <p class="note" title="Representation-specific entries">
Note that entries that contain representation-specific syntax will only have
special processing rules defined by a single <a>representation</a>. Consumers of a
different <a>representation</a> are required to include these entries in the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> using only their generic type processing rules
to enable lossless conversion of <a>representations</a>. Similarly, producers are
required to treat entries containing representation-specific syntax using
generic type processing rules when producing a <a>representation</a> for which
the entry is not defined. <a>Representations</a> are required to define
producer behavior for any such entries defined by the <a>representation</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="note" title="Representation lexical and value space">
It is RECOMMENDED that <a>representations</a> use the lexical representation
of registered data types. For example, JSON and JSON-LD use the XML
Schema dateTime lexical representation to represent <a>datetimes</a>.
A <a>representation</a> MAY choose to represent the data types differently.
For example, some CBOR-based <a>representations</a> express <a>datetime</a>
values using integers to represent the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.
    </p>

    <p>
The production and consumption rules in this section apply to all
implementations seeking to be fully compatible with independent implementations
of the specification. Deployments of this specification MAY use a custom
agreed-upon <a>representation</a>, including rules agreed to by a pair of producers
and consumers for handling properties not listed in the registry. See Section
<a href="#extensibility"></a> for more information.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Representation Requirements</h2>
      <p>
The <a href="#data-model">data model</a> provided in this specification
supports being serialized into a variety of existing <a>representations</a>. Some
applications might require the creation of a new <a>representation</a>. All
<a>representations</a> require the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>representation</a> MUST define an unambiguous encoding and decoding for all
property names and all <a href="#data-model">data model</a> <a
href="#data-model">data types</a> as defined in this specification. This enables
anything that can be represented in the  <a href="#data-model">data model</a> to
also be represented in a compliant <a>representation</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>representation</a> MUST be uniquely associated with an IANA-registered MIME
type.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>representation</a> MUST define fragment processing rules for its MIME type that
are conformant with the fragment processing rules defined in section
<a href="#fragment"></a> of this specification.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>representation</a> MAY define representation-specific syntax that can be stored
as entries in the <a href="#data-model">data model</a>. These entries are
included when consuming or producing to aid in ensuring lossless conversion.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
In order to maximize interoperability, <a>representation</a> specification authors
SHOULD register their <a>representation</a> in the DID Specification
Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

JSON-LD
      </h2>

      <p>
JSON-LD is a JSON-based format used to serialize
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data">Linked Data</a>.
This section establishes the requirements for producing and consuming <a>DID
documents</a> that are expressed as JSON-LD. JSON-LD <a>DID documents</a>
are indicated by a <code>contentType</code> resolver metadata field that is
set to <code>application/did+ld+json</code>.
      </p>

      <p class="issue atrisk" data-number="208">
Use of the media type <code>application/did+ld+json</code> is pending
clarification over the registration of
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-w3cdidwg-media-types-with-multiple-suffixes">
media types with multiple suffixes</a>. The alternative will be to use
<code>application/ld+json</code> with an expected profile parameter of
<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/did/json-ld-profile</code> if multiple suffixes
cannot be registered by the time the rest of DID Core is ready for W3C
Proposed Recommendation.
      </p>

      <p>
The following application-specific modifications are made by this specification
to the JSON-LD specification [[JSON-LD11]] to ease interoperability between
JSON and JSON-LD implementations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
The <code>@id</code> and <code>@type</code> keywords are aliased to
<code><a>id</a></code> and <code>type</code> respectively, enabling developers
to use this specification as idiomatic JSON.
        </li>
        <li>
Even though JSON-LD allows any IRI as node identifiers, <a>DID documents</a>
are explicitly restricted to only describe <a>DIDs</a>. This means that the value of
<code><a>id</a></code> that refers to the <a>DID subject</a> MUST be a valid
<a>DID</a> and not any other kind of IRI.
        </li>
        <li>
Data types, such as integers, dates, units of measure, and URLs, are
automatically typed to provide stronger type guarantees for use cases that
require them.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <section>
        <h3>Production</h3>

        <p>
The <a>DID document</a> MUST be serialized according to the
<a href="#production">production rules for JSON</a>, with one additional
requirement: The <a>DID document</a> MUST include the <code>@context</code>
entry.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>@context</dt>
          <dd>

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#the-context">JSON-LD
specification</a> defines values that are valid for this entry. This entry
contains representation-specific syntax and therefore could be present in the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> to aid in lossless conversion. If the entry
is present in the <a href="#data-model">data model</a>, it MUST be used during
production unless either an alternative <code>@context</code> value is
explicitly provided to the producer or if the value from the data model is not
valid according to the consumption rules.
            </p>

            <p>
The value of <code>@context</code> MUST be exactly one of these values.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
The <a href="https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#strings">INFRA string</a>
<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1</code>.
                <pre class="example">
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  ...
}
                </pre>
              </li>
              <li>
An <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">INFRA ordered set</a>,
with first item the <a href="https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#strings">INFRA
string</a> <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1</code>, and subsequent items of
type <a href="https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#strings">INFRA string</a> or
<a href="https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#maps">INFRA map</a>.
                <pre class="example">
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://example.com/blockchain-identity/v1"
  ],
  ...
}
                </pre>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
All members of the <code>@context</code> property SHOULD exist in the DID
Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]] in order to achieve
interoperability across different <a>representations</a>. If a member does not exist
in the DID Specification Registries, then the <a>DID document</a> might not be
interoperable across <a>representations</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
It is RECOMMENDED that dereferencing each <a>URI</a> value of the
<code>@context</code> entry results in a document containing
machine-readable information about the context. Note that further expectations
of additional JSON-LD contexts are described as part of the DID Specification
Registries registration process.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
Producers SHOULD NOT produce <a>DID documents</a> that contain properties not
defined via the <code>@context</code>. Properties that are not defined via the
<code>@context</code> MAY be dropped by Consumers.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Consumption</h3>

        <p>
The <a>DID document</a> MUST be deserialized as a JSON document according to
the <a href="#consumption">consumption rules for JSON</a>, with one additional
requirement: The <a>DID document</a> MUST include the <code>@context</code>
entry and be processed according to the rules below.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>@context</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
The value of the <code>@context</code> entry conforms to the
<a href="#production-0">JSON-LD Production Rules</a>. If more than one
<a>URI</a> is provided, the <a>URIs</a> MUST be interpreted as an
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">ordered set</a>.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

      <h2>CBOR</h2>
      <p>
Like Javascript Object Notation (JSON) [[RFC8259]], Concise Binary Object
Representation (CBOR) [[RFC7049]] defines a set of formatting rules for the
portable representation of structured data. CBOR is a more concise,
machine-readable, language-independent data interchange format that is
self-describing and has built-in semantics for interoperability.
      </p>

      <p>
The following sections outline the rules for producing and consuming
<a>DID documents</a> that are expressed in CBOR as indicated by a
<code>contentType</code> of <code>application/did+cbor</code> in the resolver
metadata.

A <a>DID document</a> MUST be a single <a data-cite="RFC7049#section-2.1">CBOR
Map</a> conforming to [[RFC7049]]. All topmost entries of the <a>DID
document</a> MUST be represented by using the entry key as the name of the
key of the CBOR Map. The values of entries of the <a href="#data-model">data
model</a> described in Section <a href="#data-model"></a>, including all
extensions, are encoded in CBOR [[RFC7049]] by mapping entry values to CBOR

        <ul>
          <li>Entry keys MUST be represented as text string (major type 3) and contain only UTF-8 strings.</li>
          <li>Undefined Values of Required Properties as defined in <a href="#data-model">the Data Model</a> that are absent from the CBOR representation SHOULD be labeled with Primitive type (major type 7) with value 23 (Undefined value).</li>
          <li>Entry keys in each CBOR map MUST be unique.</li>
          <li>Integer encoding MUST be as short as possible.</li>
          <li>The expression of lengths in CBOR major types 2 through 5 MUST be as short as possible.</li>
          <li>The keys in every map must be sorted lowest value to highest. Sorting is performed on the bytes of the representation of the keys. If two keys have different lengths, the shorter one sorts earlier.  If two keys have the same length, the one with the lower value in (byte-wise) lexical order sorts earlier.</li>

      <p>
All entries of the <a>DID document</a> represented in CBOR MUST be included in
the root map (major type 5). Entries MAY define additional data sub structures
represented as nested CBOR maps (major type 5) and is subject to the value
representation rules in the lists above and conformance to section <a

        <h3>CBOR Extensibility</h3>
        <p>
In CBOR, one point of extensibility is with the use of CBOR tags. [[RFC7049]]
defines a basic set of data types, as well as a tagging mechanism that enables
extending the set of data types supported via the <a
href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">IANA CBOR Tag
Registry</a>. This allows for tags to enhance the semantic description of the
data that follows.  Extensibility with CBOR tags also facilitates lossless
conversion to other core <a>representations</a>. CBOR Tags number 21 to 23 indicate
that a following byte string might require a specific encoding when
interoperating with a text-based <a>representation</a> such as JSON.  These tags are
useful when an encoder knows that the byte string data it is writing is likely
to be later converted to a particular text-based usage such as JSON.  These
three tag numbers suggest conversions to three of the base data encodings
defined in [[RFC4648]].  Tag number 21 suggests conversion to base64url encoding
(Section 5 of [[RFC4648]]), where padding is not used (see Section 3.2 of
[[RFC4648]]); that is, all trailing equals signs ("=") are removed from the
encoded string.  Tag number 22 suggests conversion to classical base64 encoding
(Section 4 of [[RFC4648]] ), with padding as defined in [[RFC4648]].  For both
base64url and base64, padding bits are set to zero (see Section 3.5 of
[[RFC4648]] ), and encoding is performed without the inclusion of any line
breaks, whitespace, or other additional characters.  Tag number 23 suggests
conversion to base16 (hex) encoding, with uppercase alphabetics (see Section 8
of [[RFC4648]]).  Note that, for all three tag numbers, the encoding of the
empty byte string is the empty text string of other <a>representations</a>.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>DagCBOR</h4>
          <p>
DagCBOR is a further restricted subset of CBOR for representing the <a>DID Document</a>
as a Directed Acyclic Graph model using canonical CBOR encoding
with additional constraints. DagCBOR requires that there exist a single way of
encoding any given object, and that encoded forms contain no superfluous data
that may be ignored or lost in a round-trip decode/encode.
          </p>

          <p>
When producing and consuming DID Documents representing in DagCBOR the following
rules are followed:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
CBOR tags other than the CID tag (42) MUST NOT be used.
            </li>
          </ul>

    <h1>Methods</h1>

    <p>
<a>DID methods</a> provide the means to implement this specification on
different <a>verifiable data registries</a>. New <a>DID methods</a> are
defined in their own specifications, so that interoperability between
different implementations of the same <a>DID method</a> is ensured. This
section specifies the requirements on any <a>DID method</a>, which are met by
the <a>DID method</a>'s associated specification.
    </p>

    <p>
For adding properties to a <a>DID document</a> which are specific to a
particular <a>DID method</a>, see <a href="#extensibility"></a>.
    </p>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2>Method Schemes</h2>

      <p>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST define exactly one method-specific
<a>DID scheme</a>, identified by exactly one method name (see the
<code>method-name</code> rule in Section <a href="#did-syntax"></a>).
      </p>

      <p>
The authors of a new <a>DID method</a> specification are expected to use a
method name that is unique among all <a>DID method</a> names known to them at
the time of publication.
      </p>

      <div class="note" title="Unique DID method names">
        <p>
Because there is no central authority for allocating or approving <a>DID
method</a> names, there is no way to know for certain if a specific <a>DID
method</a> name is unique. To help with this challenge, a non-authoritative list
of known <a>DID method</a> names and their associated specifications is
maintained in the DID Methods Registry, which is part of the DID Specification
Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
        </p>
        <p>
Authors of new <a>DID method</a> specifications are encouraged to add their
method names to the DID Methods Registry so that other implementors
and members of the community have a place to see an overview of existing
<a>DID methods</a>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how to generate the
<code>method-specific-id</code> component of a <a>DID</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
Case sensitivity and normalization of the value of the
<code>method-specific-id</code> rule MUST be defined by the <a>DID method</a>
specification.
      </p>
      <p>
The <code>method-specific-id</code> value MUST be able to be generated without
the use of a centralized registry service.
      </p>
      <p>
The <code>method-specific-id</code> value might be globally unique by itself.
The <code>method-specific-id</code> value MUST be unique within a method.
Any <a>DID</a> generated by the method MUST be globally unique.
      </p>

      <p>
If needed, a method-specific <a>DID scheme</a> MAY define multiple
<code>method-specific-id</code> formats.
      </p>

      <p>
The <code>method-specific-id</code> format MAY include colons. The use of
colons MUST comply syntactically with the <code>method-specific-id</code> ABNF
rule.
      </p>
      <p class="note" title="Colons in method-specific-id">
The meaning of colons in the <code>method-specific-id</code> is entirely
method-specific. Colons might be used by <a>DID methods</a> for establishing
hierarchically partitioned namespaces, for identifying specific instances or
parts of the <a>verifiable data registry</a>, or for other purposes.
Implementers are advised to avoid assuming any meanings or
behaviors associated with a colon that are generically applicable to all
<a>DID methods</a>.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Method Operations</h2>
      <p>
This section sets out the requirements for <a>DID method</a> specifications
with regards to operations that can be performed on a <a>DID document</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
Determining the authority of a party to carry out the operations is
method-specific. For example, a <a>DID method</a> might:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
make use of the <code><a>controller</a></code> property.
        </li>
        <li>
use the <a>verification methods</a> listed under
<code><a>authentication</a></code> to decide whether an update/deactivate
operation is allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
use other constructs in the <a>DID Document</a> to decide if, for example, a
<a>verification method</a> specified under <code><a>capabilityInvocation</a></code>
could be used to verify the invocation of a capability to update the <a>DID
Document</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
not use the <a>DID document</a> at all to decide this, but have rules that are
"built into" the method.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
Each <a>DID method</a> MUST define how authorization to perform <a>DID method</a>
operations is implemented, including any necessary cryptographic operations.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Create</h3>

        <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a <a>DID controller</a>
creates a <a>DID</a> and its associated <a>DID document</a> on the <a>verifiable
data registry</a>, including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish
proof of control.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Read/Verify</h3>

        <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a <a>DID resolver</a> uses
a <a>DID</a> to request a <a>DID document</a> from the <a>verifiable data
registry</a>, including how the <a>DID resolver</a> can verify the authenticity
of the response.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Update</h3>

        <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a <a>DID controller</a> can
update a <a>DID document</a> on the <a>verifiable data registry</a>, including
all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of control,
<em>or</em> state that updates are not possible.
        </p>

        <p>
An update to a <a>DID</a> is any change, after creation, in the data used to
produce a <a>DID document</a>. <a>DID Method</a> implementers are responsible
for defining what constitutes an update, and what properties of the <a>DID
document</a> are supported by a given <a>DID method</a>. For example, an update
operation which replaces key material without changing it could be a valid
update that does not result in changes to the <a>DID document</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Deactivate</h3>

        <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a <a>DID controller</a> can
deactivate a <a>DID</a> on the <a>verifiable data registry</a>, including all
cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of deactivation,
<em>or</em> state that deactivation is not possible.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security Requirements</h2>
      <p>
<a>DID method</a> specifications MUST include their own Security
Considerations sections. This section MUST consider all the requirements
mentioned in section 5 of [[RFC3552]] (page 27) for the <a>DID</a> operations
defined in the specification.
      </p>
      <p>
At least the following forms of attack MUST be considered: eavesdropping,
replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle.
Potential denial of service attacks MUST be identified as well.
      </p>
      <p>
This section MUST discuss, per Section 5 of [[RFC3552]], residual risks (such
as the risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation,
or cipher) after threat mitigation was deployed.
      </p>
      <p>
This section MUST provide integrity protection and update authentication for
all operations required by Section <a href="#method-operations"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
If the technology involves authentication, particularly user-host
authentication, the security of the authentication method MUST be clearly
specified.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DID methods</a> MUST discuss the policy mechanism by which <a>DIDs</a> are proven to be uniquely assigned.
      </p>
      <p>
Method-specific endpoint authentication MUST be discussed. Where <a>DID
methods</a> make use of <a>DLTs</a> with varying network topology, sometimes
offered as <em>light node</em> or <em>
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security">thin client</a></em>
implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security assumptions
of the topology available to implementations of the <a>DID method</a> MUST be
discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
If the protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, the
<a>DID method</a> specification MUST clearly indicate which portions of the
data are protected and what the protections are, and SHOULD give an indication
to what sorts of attacks the cryptographic protection is susceptible.
For example, integrity only, confidentiality, endpoint authentication, and so
on.
      </p>
      <p>
Data which is to be held secret (keying material, random seeds, and so on)
SHOULD be clearly labeled.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DID method</a> specifications SHOULD explain and specify the implementation
of signatures on <a>DID documents</a>, if applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
Where <a>DID methods</a> make use of peer-to-peer computing resources, such as
with all known <a>DLTs</a>, the expected burdens of those resources SHOULD be
discussed in relation to denial of service.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DID methods</a> that introduce new authentication <a>service</a>
types (see Section <a href="#services"></a>) SHOULD consider the
security requirements of the supported authentication protocol.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class='normative'>
      <h2>Privacy Requirements</h2>

      <p>
<a>DID method</a> specifications MUST include their own Privacy
Considerations sections, if only to point to
<a href="#privacy-considerations"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification's Privacy Considerations section MUST
discuss any subsection of Section 5 of [[RFC6973]] that could apply in a
method-specific manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored
data compromise, unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation,
identification, secondary use, disclosure, exclusion.
      </p>

    <h1>Resolution</h1>

    <p class="issue atrisk" data-number="549">
The Working Group is unsure if there will be enough implementation experience
for the DID Resolution section. We are seeking feedback from the implementation
community as to whether they prefer to do all of this work now, or if they would
prefer that this section is, or parts of the section are, rewritten to be non-normative,
or published as a NOTE and taken up in a future W3C DID Resolution Working
Group. If there is support for rewriting a subset of the DID Resolution section,
or publishing any part of it as a NOTE during the W3C Candidate Recommendation
process, this section will be modified and/or published as a NOTE appropriately
before the DID Core specification proceeds to the W3C Proposed
Recommendation stage.

    <p>
This section defines the inputs and outputs of <a>DID resolution</a> and <a>DID
URL dereferencing</a>. These functions are defined in an abstract way. Their
exact implementation is out of scope for this specification, but some

accomplished are outside the scope of this specification, but all conformant
implementations implement two functions which have the following abstract
forms:
        </p>

        <p><code>
resolve ( did, did-resolution-input-metadata ) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt; ( did-resolution-metadata, did-document, did-document-metadata )
        </code></p>

        <p><code>
resolveRepresentation ( did, did-resolution-input-metadata ) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt; ( did-resolution-metadata, did-document-stream, did-document-metadata )
        </code></p>

        <p>
The <code>resolve</code> function returns the <a>DID document</a> in its
abstract form.
The <code>resolveRepresentation</code> function returns a byte stream of the
<a>DID Document</a> formatted in the corresponding representation.
        </p>
        <p>
The input variables of these functions are as follows:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>
did
            </dt>
            <dd>
This is the <a>DID</a> to resolve. This input is REQUIRED and the value MUST
be a conformant <a>DID</a> as defined in <a href="#did-syntax"></a>.
            </dd>
            <dt>
did-resolution-input-metadata
            </dt>
            <dd>
A <a href="#metadata-structure">metadata structure</a> consisting of input
options to the <code>resolve</code> and <code>resolveRepresentation</code>
functions in addition to the <code>did</code> itself. Properties defined by this
specification are in <a href="#did-resolution-input-metadata-properties"></a>.
This input is REQUIRED, but the structure MAY be empty.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
The output variables of these functions are as follows:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>
did-resolution-metadata
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
A <a href="#metadata-structure">metadata structure</a> consisting of values
relating to the results of the <a>DID resolution</a> process. This structure
is REQUIRED and MUST NOT be empty.
              </p>
              <p>
This metadata typically changes between invocations of the
<code>resolve</code> and <code>resolveRepresentation</code> functions as it
represents data about the resolution process itself. Properties defined by
this specification are in <a href="#did-resolution-metadata-properties"></a>.
              </p>
              <p>
If the resolution is successful, and if the <code>resolveRepresentation</code>
function was called, this structure MUST contain a <code>contentType</code>
property containing the mime-type of the <code>did-document-stream</code> in
this result. If the resolution is not successful, this structure MUST contain
an <code>error</code> property describing the error.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
did-document
            </dt>
            <dd>
If the resolution is successful, and if the <code>resolve</code> function was
called, this MUST be a <a>conforming DID document</a>. If the resolution is
unsuccessful, this value MUST be empty.

            <dt>
did-document-stream
            </dt>
            <dd>
If the resolution is successful, and if the <code>resolveRepresentation</code>
function was called, this MUST be a byte stream of the resolved <a>DID
document</a> in one of the conformant
<a href="#representations">representations</a>. The byte stream might then be
parsed by the caller of the <code>resolveRepresentation</code> function into a
<a href="#data-model">data model</a>, which can in turn be validated and
processed. If the resolution is unsuccessful, this value MUST be an empty
stream.
            </dd>
            <dt>
did-document-metadata
            </dt>
            <dd>
If the resolution is successful, this MUST be a <a

metadata about the <a>DID document</a> contained in the
<code>did-document</code> or <code>did-document-stream</code>. This metadata
typically does not change between invocations of the <code>resolve</code>
function unless the <a>DID document</a> changes, as it represents data about
the <a>DID document</a>. If the resolution is unsuccessful, this output MUST
be an empty <a href="#metadata-structure">metadata structure</a>. Properties
defined by this specification are in <a

        </dl>

        <p>
Conforming <a>DID resolver</a> implementations do not alter the signature of
these functions in any way. <a>DID resolver</a> implementations might map the
<code>resolve</code> and <code>resolveRepresentation</code> functions to a
method-specific internal function to perform the actual <a>DID resolution</a>
process. <a>DID resolver</a> implementations might implement and expose
additional functions with different signatures in addition to the
<code>resolve</code> function specified here.

            <h4>equivalentId</h4>
                <p>
A <a>DID Method</a> can define different forms of a <a>DID</a> that are logically
equivalent. An example is when a <a>DID</a> takes one form prior to registration in a
<a>verifiable data registry</a> and another form after such registration. In this case,
the <a>DID Method</a> specification may need to express one or more <a>DIDs</a> that
are logically equivalent to the resolved <a>DID</a> as a property of the <a>DID document</a>.
This is the purpose of the <code><a>equivalentId</a></code>  property.
                </p>

                  <dt><dfn>equivalentId</dfn></dt>

href="#did-syntax"></a>.
                  </dd>
                  <dd>
The relationship is a statement that each <code><a>equivalentId</a></code> value
is logically equivalent to the <code>id</code> property value and thus
identifies the same <a>DID subject</a>.
                  </dd>
                  <dd>
Each <code><a>equivalentId</a></code> DID value MUST be produced by, and a form
of, the same <a>DID Method</a> as the <code>id</code> property value. (e.g.
<code>did:example:abc</code> == <code>did:example:ABC</code>)
                  </dd>
                  <dd>
A conforming <a>DID Method</a> specification MUST guarantee that each

<code>id</code> property value.
                  </dd>
                  <dd>
A requesting party is expected to retain the values from the <code>id</code> and
<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> properties to ensure any subsequent
interactions with any of the values they contain are correctly handled as
logically equivalent (e.g. retain all variants in a database so an interaction
with any one maps to the same underlying account). <span class="issue">The

A requesting party is expected to use the <code><a>canonicalId</a></code> value

      <h2>DID URL Dereferencing</h2>
      <p>
The <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> function dereferences a <a>DID URL</a> into
a <a>resource</a> with contents depending on the <a>DID URL</a>'s components,
including the <a>DID method</a>, method-specific identifier, path, query,
and fragment. This process depends on <a>DID resolution</a> of the <a>DID</a>
contained in the <a>DID URL</a>. <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> might involve
multiple steps (e.g., when the DID URL being dereferenced includes a fragment),
and the function is defined to return the final resource after all
steps are completed.
The details of how this process is accomplished are outside the scope of this
specification, but all conformant implementations implement a function
which has the following abstract form:
      </p>

      <p><code>
dereference ( did-url, did-url-dereferencing-input-metadata ) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt; ( did-url-dereferencing-metadata, content-stream, content-metadata )

The input variables of this function are as follows:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>
did-url
        </dt>
        <dd>
A conformant <a>DID URL</a> as a single string. This is the <a>DID URL</a> to
dereference. To dereference a <a>DID fragment</a>, the complete <a>DID URL</a>
including the <a>DID fragment</a> MUST be used. This input is REQUIRED.
        </dd>
        <dt>
did-url-dereferencing-input-metadata
        </dt>
        <dd>
A <a href="metadata-structure">metadata structure</a> consisting of input
options to the <code>dereference</code> function in addition to the

<a href="#did-url-dereferencing-input-metadata-properties"></a>. This input is
REQUIRED, but the structure MAY be empty.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
The output variables of this function are as follows:

      <dl>
        <dt>

        <dd>
A <a href="metadata-structure">metadata structure</a> consisting of values
relating to the results of the <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> process. This
structure is REQUIRED and in the case of an error in the dereferencing process,
this MUST NOT be empty.
Properties defined by this specification are in
<a href="#did-url-dereferencing-metadata-properties"></a>.
If the dereferencing is not successful, this structure MUST contain an
<code>error</code> property describing the error.
        </dd>
        <dt>
content-stream
        </dt>
        <dd>
If the <code>dereferencing</code> function was called and successful, this MUST
contain a <a>resource</a> corresponding to the <a>DID URL</a>.
The <code>content-stream</code> SHOULD be a <a>DID document</a> in one of the
conformant <a>representations</a> obtained through
the resolution process.

If the dereferencing is unsuccessful, this value MUST be empty.

        <h2>Metadata Structure</h2>

        <p>
Input and output metadata is often involved during the <a>DID Resolution</a>,
<a>DID URL dereferencing</a>, and other DID-related processes. The structure
used to communicate this metadata MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>
of properties. Each property name MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>. Each property value MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>, <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>, <a
data-cite="INFRA#list">list</a>, <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">ordered
set</a>, <a data-cite="INFRA#boolean">boolean</a>, or
<a data-cite="INFRA#null">null</a>. The values within any complex data
structures such as maps and lists MUST be one of these data types as well.
All metadata property definitions MUST define the value type, including any
additional formats or restrictions to that value (for example, a string
formatted as a date or as a decimal integer). It is RECOMMENDED that property
definitions use strings for values.
        </p>

        <p>
All implementations of functions that use metadata structures as either input
or output are able to fully represent all data types described here in a
deterministic fashion. As inputs and outputs using metadata structures are
defined in terms of data types and not their serialization, the method for
<a>representation</a> is internal to the implementation of the function and is out of
scope of this specification.
        </p>

      <h2>Binding of Identity</h2>

      <p>
The following sections describe binding identities to <a>DIDs</a> and
<a>DID documents</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Proving Control of a DID and DID Document</h3>

        <p>
Signatures and <a>verifiable timestamps</a> allow <a>DID documents</a> to be
cryptographically verifiable.
        </p>

        <p>
By itself, a verified signature on a self-signed <a>DID document</a> does not
prove control of a <a>DID</a>. It only proves that the:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
<a>DID document</a> was not tampered with since it was timestamped.
          </li>

          <li>
<a>DID controller(s)</a> controlled the private key used for the signature at
the time the timestamp was created.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
Proving control of a <a>DID</a>, that is, the <a>binding</a> between the <a>DID</a>
and the <a>DID document</a> that describes it, requires a two step process:
        </p>

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
Resolving the <a>DID</a> to a <a>DID document</a> according to its
<a>DID method</a> specification.
          </li>

          <li>
Verifying that the <code><a>id</a></code> property of the resulting <a>DID
document</a> matches the <a>DID</a> that was resolved.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
It should be noted that this process proves control of a <a>DID</a> and
<a>DID document</a> regardless of whether the <a>DID document</a> is signed.
        </p>

        <p>
Signatures on <a>DID documents</a> are optional. <a>DID method</a>
specifications are expected to explain and specify their implementation if
applicable.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Proving Control of a Public Key</h3>

        <p>
There are two methods for proving control of the private key corresponding to a
<a>public key description</a> in the <a>DID document</a>: static and dynamic.
        </p>

        <p>
The static method is to sign the <a>DID document</a> with the private key. This
proves control of the private key at a time no later than the
<a>DID document</a> was registered. If the <a>DID document</a> is not signed,
control of a public key described in the <a>DID document</a> can still be proven
dynamically as follows:
        </p>

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
Send a challenge message containing a <a>public key description</a> from the
<a>DID document</a> and a nonce to an appropriate <a>service endpoint</a>
described in the <a>DID document</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
Verify the signature of the response message against the
<a>public key description</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Real-World Identity</h3>

        <p>
A <a>DID</a> and <a>DID document</a> do not inherently carry any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">
  PII</a>
(personally-identifiable information).
        </p>

        <p>
It can be useful to express a binding of <a>DID</a> to a person's or company's
real world identity, in a way that is provably asserted by a trusted authority
such as a government. This can enable interactions that can be considered
legally valid under one or more jurisdictions; establishing such bindings has to
be carefully balanced against privacy considerations (see <a
href="#privacy-considerations"></a>).
        </p>

        <p>
The process of binding a <a>DID</a> to something in the real world, such as a
person or a company, for example using <a>verifiable credentials</a> with the
same subject as that <a>DID</a>, is out of scope for this specification. For
more information, see the Verifiable Credentials Data Model [[VC-DATA-MODEL]].
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Authentication Service Endpoints</h2>

      <p>
If a <a>DID document</a> publishes a <a>service</a> intended for
authentication or authorization of the <a>DID subject</a> (see Section <a
href="#services"></a>), it is the responsibility of the <a>service
endpoint</a> provider, subject, or requesting party to comply with the
requirements of the authentication protocols supported at that <a>service
endpoint</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Non-Repudiation</h2>

      <p>
Non-repudiation of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID document</a> updates is supported
under the assumption that the subject:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Is monitoring for unauthorized updates (see Section
<a href="#notification-of-did-document-changes"></a>).
        </li>
        <li>
Has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious updates according to the
access control mechanism for the <a>DID method</a> (see Section
<a href="#authentication"></a>).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
Non-repudiation is further supported if timestamps are included (see Section
<a href="#did-document-metadata-properties"></a>) and the target <a>DLT</a>
system supports timestamps.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Notification of DID Document Changes</h2>

      <p>
One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a <a>DID document</a> is
monitoring and actively notifying the <a>DID subject</a> when there are changes.
This is analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to the email
addresses on file.
      </p>
      <p>
In the case of a <a>DID</a>, there is no intermediary registrar or account
provider to generate such notifications. However, if the <a>verifiable data
registry</a> on which the <a>DID</a> is registered directly supports change
notifications, a subscription service can be offered to <a>DID controllers</a>.
Notifications could be sent directly to the relevant <a>service endpoints</a>
listed in an existing <a>DID</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
If a <a>DID controller</a> chooses to rely on a third-party monitoring service
(other than the <a>verifiable data registry</a> itself), this introduces another
vector of attack.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key and Signature Expiration</h2>

      <p>
In a <a>decentralized identifier</a> architecture, there are no centralized
authorities to enforce key or signature expiration policies. Therefore
<a>DID resolvers</a> and requesting parties need to validate that keys
were not expired at the time they were used. Because some use cases have
legitimate reasons why already-expired keys can be extended, make sure key
expiration does not prevent any further use of the key. Implementations
of a resolver ought to be compatible with such extension behavior.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>

      <h2>Verification Method Rotation</h2>

      <p>Verification method rotation is a proactive security measure.</p>

      <p>
        Verification method rotation applies only to the current or latest
        version of a DID Document.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a verification method has been active for a long time, or used
        for many operations, a controller might wish to perform a rotation.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
        It is considered a best practice to perform verification method
        rotation on a regular basis.
      </p>


      <p class="advisement">
        Proofs or signatures that rely on verification methods that are not
        present in the latest version of a DID Document are not impacted by
        rotation, and might require additional information to mitigate compromise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Section <a href="#method-operations"></a> specifies the
        <a>DID</a> operations to be supported by a
        <a>DID method</a> specification, including
        <a href="#update">update</a>
        which is expected to be used to perform a verification method rotation.
      </p>

      <p>
        A controller performs a rotation when they add a new verification
        method that is meant to replace an existing verification method after
        some time.
      </p>

      <p>Not all DID Methods support verification method rotation.</p>

      <p>
        Rotation is a key management process that enables the private cryptographic
        material associated with an existing verification method to be deactivated
        or destroyed once a new verification method has been added to the DID
        Document. Going forward, any new proofs that a controller would have generated
        using the old cryptographic material can now instead be generated using the new
        material and can be verified using the new verification method.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rotation is a useful mechanism for protecting against verification
        method compromise, since frequent rotation of a verification method by
        the controller reduces the value of a single compromised verification method
        to an attacker. Performing revocation immediately after rotation is
        useful for verification methods that a controller designates for
        short-lived verifications, such as those involved in encrypting messages
        and authentication.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Higher security environments tend to employ more frequent verification
        method rotation.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Frequent rotation of a verification method might be frustrating for
        parties that are forced to continuously renew or refresh associated
        credentials.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>

      <h2>Verification Method Revocation</h2>

      <p>
Verification method revocation is a reactive security measure.
      </p>

      <p>
Verification method revocation applies only to the current or latest
version of a DID Document.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a verification method is no longer exclusively accessible to the
        controller or parties trusted to act on behalf of the controller, it
        is expected to be revoked immediately to reduce the risk of masquerading, theft,
        and fraud.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
It is considered a best practice to support key revocation.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
A controller is expected to immediately revoke any verification method that is believed to
be compromised.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
Revocation is expected to be understood as a controller expressing
that proofs or signatures associated with a revoked verification method
might have been created by an attacker. Verifiers, however, might
still choose to accept or reject such proofs or signatures at their
own discretion.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
As described in Section <a href="#verification-method-types"></a>,
absence of a verification method is the only form of revocation that
applies to all DID Methods.
      </p>

      <p>
Section <a href="#method-operations"></a> specifies the <a>DID</a>
operations to be supported by a <a>DID method</a> specification,
including <a href="#update">update</a> and <a href="#deactivate">
deactivate</a> which might be used to remove verification method from
a DID Document.
      </p>

      <p>
Not all DID Methods support verification method revocation.
      </p>

      <p>
Even if a verification method is present in a DID Document, additional
information, such as a public key revocation certificate, or an external
allow or deny list, might be used to determine whether a verification
method has been revoked.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
Compromise of the secrets associated with a verification method
allows the attacker to use them according to the verification
relationship expressed by controller in the DID Document, for
example, for authentication. The attacker's use of the secrets might
be indistinguishable from the legitimate controller's use starting
from the time the verification method was registered, to the time it
was revoked.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
The day-to-day operation of any software relying on a compromised verification
method, such as an individual's operating system, antivirus, or endpoint protection
software, might be impacted when the verification method is publicly revoked.
      </p>

<p class="note">
Although verifiers might choose not to accept proofs or signatures from a revoked verification method,
knowing whether a verification was made with a revoked verification method is trickier than it might seem.
Some DID methods provide the ability to look back at the state of a DID at a point in time,
or at a particular version of the DID document. When such a feature is
combined with a reliable way to determine the time or DID version that existed
when a cryptographically verifiable statement was made, then revocation
does not undo that statement. This can be the basis for using DIDs to make
binding commitments (e.g., to sign a mortgage).
<br><br>
If these conditions are met, revocation is not retroactive; it only nullifies future use of the method.
<br/><br/>
However, in order for such semantics to be safe, the second condition &mdash;
an ability to know what the state of the DID document was at the time the
assertion was made &mdash; is expected to apply. Without that guarantee, someone
could discover a revoked key and use it to make cryptographically
verifiable statements with a simulated date in the past.
<br/><br/>
Some DID methods only allow the retrieval of the current state of a DID.
When this is true, or when the state of a DID at the time of
cryptographically verifiable statement cannot be reliably determined,
then the only safe interpretation of revocation is to make it
apply both forward and backward in time. DID ecosystems that
take this approach essentially provide cryptographically verifiable
statements as ephemeral tokens that can be invalidated at any time by
the DID controller.

      <h2>DID Recovery</h2>

      <p>
        Recovery is a reactive security measure, whereby a controller is able
        to regain the ability to perform DID operations.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
        Recovery is advised when a controller or services trusted to act on
        their behalf no longer have the exclusive ability to perform DID
        operations as described in <a href="#method-operations"></a>.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
        It is considered a best practice to never reuse a verification method
        or key material associated with recovery for any other purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recovery is commonly performed in conjunction with
        <a href="#verification-method-rotation">verification method rotation</a>
<!--FIXME: Add link to section when section becomes merged -->
        and verification method revocation.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are no common recovery mechanisms that apply to all DID Methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a>DID method</a> specifications might choose to enable support for a
        quorum of trusted parties to faciliate recovery. Some of the
        facilities to do so are suggested in Section
        <a href="#did-controller"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not all <a>DID method</a> specifications will recognize control from
        <a>DIDs</a> registered using other <a>DID methods</a> and they might
        restrict third-party control to <a>DIDs</a> that use the same method.
      </p>

      <p>
        Access control and recovery in a <a>DID method</a>
        specification can also include a time lock feature to protect against
        key compromise by maintaining a second track of control for recovery.

      <p class="note">
        Performing recovery proactively on an infrequent but regular basis,
        can help to ensure that control has not been lost.

      <h2>The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers</h2>

      <p>
<a>DIDs</a> achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central
registration authority. This comes at the cost of human memorability.
The algorithms capable of generating globally unique identifiers
produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning (see also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko's
Triangle</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
There are use cases where it is desirable to discover a <a>DID</a> when
starting from a human-friendly identifier. For example, a natural language
name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a <a>DID controller</a>,
such as a mobile telephone number, email address, social media username, or
blog URL. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to
<a>DIDs</a> (and doing so in a way that can be verified and trusted) is
outside the scope of this specification.
      </p>

      <p>
Solutions to this problem should be defined in separate specifications that
reference this specification. It is strongly recommended that such
specifications carefully consider the:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly
identifier for a target entity.
        </li>
        <li>
Privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently
correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
A draft specification for discovering a <a>DID</a> from domain names and email
addresses using DNS lookups is available at [[?DNS-DID]].

        <h2>DIDs as Enhanced URNs</h2>

        <p>
If desired by a <a>DID controller</a>, a <a>DID</a> is capable of acting
as an enhanced Uniform Resource Name (URN) as defined by [[RFC8141]], i.e.,
"a persistent, location-independent resource identifier". <a>DIDs</a> used in
this way provide a cryptographically secure, location-independent identifier for
a digital resource, while also providing metadata that enables retrieval.
Because of the indirection between the <a>DID document</a> and the <a>DID</a>
itself, the <a>DID controller</a> can adjust the actual location of the resource
&mdash; or even provide the resource directly &mdash; without adjusting the
<a>DID</a>. <a>DIDs</a> of this type can definitively verify that the resource
retrieved is, in fact, the resource identified.
        </p>
        <p>
A <a>DID controller</a> who intends to use a <a>DID</a> for this purpose is
advised to follow the security considerations in [[RFC8141]]. In particular:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
The <a>DID controller</a> is expected to choose a <a>DID method</a> that
supports the controller's requirements for persistence. The Decentralized
Characteristics Rubric [[?DID-RUBRIC]] is one tool available to help
implementers decide upon the most suitable <a>DID method</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>DID controller</a> is expected to publish its operational policies so
relying parties can determine the degree to which they can rely on the
persistence of a <a>DID</a> controlled by that <a>DID controller</a>. In the
absence of such policies, relying parties are not expected to make any
assumption about whether a <a>DID</a> is a persistent identifier for the same
<a>DID subject</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Immutability</h2>

        <p>
Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and the
assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Immutability of <a>DID documents</a> can
provide some security benefits. Individual <a>DID methods</a> ought to
consider constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics they do not
need. The more <em>locked down</em> a <a>DID method</a> is, while providing
the same set of features, the less it can be manipulated by malicious actors.
        </p>
        <p>
As an example, consider that a single edit to a <a>DID document</a> can change
anything except the root <code><a>id</a></code> property of the document. But
is it actually desirable for a <a>service</a> to change its
<code>type</code> after it is defined? Or for a key to change its value? Or
would it be better to require a new <code><a>id</a></code> when certain
fundamental properties of an object change? Malicious takeovers of a website
often aim for an outcome where the site keeps its identifier (the host name),
but is subtly changed underneath. If certain properties of the site were
required by the specification to be immutable (for example, the <a
target="_blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">ASN</a>
associated with its IP address), such attacks might be much harder and more
expensive to carry out, and anomaly detection would be easier.
        </p>
        <p>
For <a>DID methods</a> tied to a global source of truth, a direct,
just-in-time lookup of the latest version of a <a>DID document</a> is always
possible. However, it seems likely that layers of cache might eventually sit
between a <a>DID resolver</a> and that source of truth. If they do, believing
the attributes of an object in the <a>DID document</a> to have a given state
when they are actually subtly different might invite exploits. This is
particularly true if some lookups are of a full <a>DID document</a>, and
others are of partial data where the larger context is assumed.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Encrypted Data in DID Documents</h2>
      <p>
Encryption algorithms have been known to fail due to advances in cryptography
and computing power. Implementers are advised to assume that any encrypted
data placed in a <a>DID document</a> might eventually be made available in
clear text to the same audience to which the encrypted data is available.
This is particularly pertinent if the <a>DID document</a> is public.
      </p>
      <p>
Encrypting all or parts of <a>DID documents</a> is <em>not</em> an appropriate means
to protect data in the long term. Similarly, placing encrypted data in <a>DID
documents</a> is not an appropriate means to include personally identifiable
information.
      </p>
      <p>
Given the caveats above, if encrypted data is included in a <a>DID document</a>,
implementers are advised to not encrypt with the public keys of entities that
do not wish to be correlated with the <a>DID</a>.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Equivalence Properties</h2>
      <p>
The three equivalence properties—<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code>, <code><a>equivalentId</a></code>, and
<code><a>canonicalId</a></code>—are subject to special security considerations
related to attacks against <a>DIDs</a> that are asserted to be equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
The <code><a>equivalentId</a></code> and <code><a>canonicalId</a></code>
properties that constrain equivalence assertions to variants of a single <a>DID</a>
produced by the same <a>DID method</a> (e.g. <code>did:foo:123</code> ≡
<code>did:foo:hash(123)</code>) can be trusted to the extent the requesting party
trusts the <a>DID method</a> (and a conforming producer) itself.
      </p>
      <p>
The <code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> property that permits an equivalence
assertion to <a>URIs</a> that are not governed by the same <a>DID method</a> (or may
not be <a>DIDs</a> at all) cannot be trusted without performing verification steps
outside of the governing <a>DID method</a>. See additional guidence in
<a href="#also-known-as"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
As with any other sensitive properties in the <a>DID document</a> (e.g. public key
references), parties relying on any equivalence statement in a <a>DID document</a>
should guard against the values of these properties being substituted by an
attacker after the proper verification has been performed. Any write access to a
<a>DID document</a> stored in memory or disk after verification has been performed is
an attack vector that will circumvent verification unless the <a>DID document</a> is
re-verified.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Content Integrity Protection</h2>
      <p>
<a>DID documents</a> which include external JSON-LD contexts (see
<a href="#json-ld"></a>) or any other links to external machine-readable
content are vulnerable to tampering.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DID document</a> consumers can cache local static copies of JSON-LD contexts
and/or verify the integrity of external contexts against the cryptographic
hash for the context as registered in the DID Specification Registries
(see the registration process for more detail) [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Persistence</h2>
      <p>
DIDs are designed to be persistent such that a controller need not rely
upon a single trusted third party or administrator to maintain their
identifiers. No administrator can take control away from the controller,
nor can an administrator prevent their identifiers' use for any particular
purpose such as authentication, authorization, and attestation. No
third party can act on behalf of a controller to remove or render
inoperable an individual's (or an organization's) identifier without the
controller's consent.
      </p>
      <p>
However, it is important to note that in all DID Methods that enable
cryptographic proof-of-control, the means of proving control can always be
transferred to another party by transferring the cryptographic secrets.
Therefore, it is vital that systems relying on the persistence of an
identifier over time regularly check to ensure that the identifier is, in
fact, still under the control of the intended party.
      </p>
      <p>
Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine from the cryptography alone
whether or not the private key material associated with a given proof
mechanism has been compromised. It might well be that the expected controller
still has access to the private keys &mdash; and as such can execute a
proof-of-control as part of a verification process &mdash; while at the same time,
a bad actor also has access to (or a copy of) those same keys.
      </p>
      <p>
As such, cryptographic proof-of-control is expected to only be used as one
factor in evaluating the level of identity assurance for a given
service. DID-based authentication provides much greater assurance than a
username and password, thanks to the ability to determine control over
a secret without transmitting that secret between systems. However, it is
not infallible. Services that perform sensitive, high value, or
life-critical operations should use additional factors as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
In addition to potential ambiguity from use by different controllers,
it is impossible to guarantee, in general, that a given DID is being used
in reference to the same subject at any given point in time. It is
technically possible for the controller to reuse a DID for different
subjects and, more subtly, for the precise definition of the Subject
to either change over time or be misunderstood.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, consider a DID used for a sole proprietership, receiving
various credentials used for financial transactions. To the controller,
that identifier referred to the business. As the business grows, it
eventually gets incorporated as an LLC. The controller continues using
that same DID, because to <strong>them</strong> the DID refers to the
business. However, to the state, the tax authority, and the local
municipality, the DID no longer refers to the same entity. Whether or
not the subtle shift in meaning matters to a credit provider or supplier
is necessarily up to them to decide. In many cases, as long as the bills
get paid and collections can be enforced, the shift is immaterial.
      </p>
      <p>
Because of these potential ambiguities, DIDs should be considered valid
<em>contextually</em> rather than absolutely. Their persistence does not
imply that they refer to the exact same Subject, nor that they are under the
control of the same controller. Instead, one needs to understand the context
in which the DID was created, how it is used, and consider the likely
shifts in their meaning, and adopt procedures and policies to address both
potential and inevitable semantic drift.

      <h2>Level of Assurance</h2>

      <p>
Additional information about the security context of authentication events
is often required for compliance reasons, especially in regulated areas
such as the financial and public sectors. Examples include but are not
limited to protection of secret keys, the identity proofing process, and the
form-factor of the authenticator. For example, <a target="_blank"
href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en">
Payment services (PSD 2)</a> and <a target="_blank"
href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG">
eIDAS</a> introduce such requirements to the security context. Level of
Assurance (LoA) frameworks are classified and defined by, for example,
<a target="_blank"
href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG">
eIDAS</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">
NIST 800-63-3</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/45138.html">
ISO/IEC 29115:2013</a>, including their requirements for the security
context, and making recommendations on how to achieve them. This might
include strong user authentication and <a href="_blank"
href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2">FIDO2</a>/<a target="_blank"
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">WebAuthn</a> can be potential
implementations. A LoA represents the level of confidence that an entity is in
fact that entity. Some regulated use cases require the implementation of a
certain LoA. Since <a>verification relationships</a> such as <code>
<a>assertionMethod</a></code> and <code><a>authentication</a></code> might be
used in some of these use cases, information about the applied security context
might need to be expressed and provided to a <em>verifier</em>.
Whether and how to encode this information in the <a>DID document</a> data model
is out of scope for this specification, but it should be noted that the <a>DID
document</a> data model can be extended if necessary (see <a
href="#extensibility">Extensibility</a> section). Section <a
href="#privacy-considerations">Privacy Considerations</a> remains applicable for
such extensions.
      </p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h1>Privacy Considerations</h1>

    <p>
It is critically important to apply the principles of Privacy by Design
[[PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN]] to all aspects of the <a>decentralized identifier</a>
architecture, because <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> are, by design,
administered directly by the <a>DID controller(s)</a>. There is no registrar,
hosting company, or other intermediate service provider to recommend or apply
additional privacy safeguards. The authors of this specification have applied
all seven Privacy by Design principles throughout its development.
Privacy in this specification is preventative not remedial, and privacy is an
embedded default.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Keep Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) Private</h2>

      <p>
If a <a>DID method</a> specification is written for a public <a>verifiable
data registry</a> where all <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> are publicly
available, it is <em>critical</em> that <a>DID documents</a> contain no
personally-identifiable information.
      </p>
      <p>
Personally-identifiable information can instead be placed behind <a>service
endpoints</a> under control of the <a>DID subject</a> or <a>DID controller</a>.
Due diligence should be taken around the use of URLs in <a>service endpoints</a>
to prevent leakage of personal data or correlation within a URL
of a <a>service endpoint</a>. For example, a URL that contains a username is
dangerous to include in a <a>DID Document</a> because the username is likely
to be human-meaningful in a way that can reveal information
that the <a>DID subject</a> did not consent to sharing. With this privacy
architecture, personal data can be exchanged on a private, peer-to-peer basis
using communications channels identified and secured by <a>public key
descriptions</a> in <a>DID documents</a>. This also enables <a>DID
subjects</a> and requesting parties to implement the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">right to be
forgotten</a>, because no personal data is written to an immutable
<a>distributed ledger</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DID Correlation Risks and Pseudonymous DIDs</h2>

      <p>
Like any type of globally unique identifier, <a>DIDs</a> might be used for
correlation. <a>DID controllers</a> can mitigate this privacy risk by using
pairwise unique <a>DIDs</a>, that is, sharing a different private <a>DID</a> for
every relationship. In effect, each <a>DID</a> acts as a pseudonym. A
pseudonymous <a>DID</a> need only be shared with more than one party when
the <a>DID subject</a> explicitly authorizes correlation between those parties.
If pseudonymous <a>DIDs</a> are the default, then the only need for a public
<a>DID</a> (a <a>DID</a> published openly or shared with a large number of
parties) is when the <a>DID subject</a> explicitly desires public
identification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DID Document Correlation Risks</h2>

      <p>
The anti-correlation protections of pseudonymous <a>DIDs</a> are easily defeated
if the data in the corresponding <a>DID documents</a> can be correlated. For
example, using same <a>public key descriptions</a> or bespoke
<a>service endpoints</a> in multiple <a>DID documents</a> can provide as much
correlation information as using the same <a>DID</a>. Therefore the
<a>DID document</a> for a pseudonymous <a>DID</a> also needs to use pairwise
unique public keys.

It might seem natural to also use pairwise unique <a>service endpoints</a> in
the <a>DID document</a> for a pseudonymous <a>DID</a>. However, unique endpoints
allow all traffic between two <a>DIDs</a> to be isolated perfectly into unique
buckets, where timing correlation and similar analysis is easy. Therefore, a
better strategy for endpoint privacy might be to share an endpoint among
thousands or millions of <a>DIDs</a> controlled by many different subjects.
See also <a href="#herd-privacy"></a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Assigning a type to the DID subject</h2>
      <p>
It is dangerous to add properties to the <a>DID document</a> that can be used
to indicate, explicitly or through inference, what <em>type</em> or nature of
thing the <a>DID subject</a> is, particularly if the <a>DID subject</a> is a
person.
      </p>
      <p>
Not only do such properties potentially result in personally identifiable
information (see
<a href="#keep-personally-identifiable-information-pii-private"></a>) or
correlatable data (see <a href="#did-correlation-risks-and-pseudonymous-dids">
</a> and <a href="#did-document-correlation-risks"></a>) being present in the
<a>DID document</a>, but they can be used for grouping particular <a>DIDs</a>
in such a way that they are included in or excluded from certain operations or
functionalities.
      </p>
      <p>
Including <em>type</em> information in a <a>DID Document</a> can
result in personal privacy harms even for <a>DID Subjects</a> that are
non-person entities, such as IoT devices. The aggregation of such
information around a <a>DID Controller</a> could serve as a form of
digital fingerprint and this is best avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
To minimize these risks, all properties in a <a>DID document</a> ought to be
for expressing cryptographic material, endpoints, or <a>verification methods</a>
related to using the <a>DID</a>.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Herd Privacy</h2>

      <p>
When a <a>DID subject</a> is indistinguishable from others in the herd,
privacy is available. When the act of engaging privately with another party is
by itself a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID
methods</a> need to work to improve herd privacy, particularly for those who
legitimately need it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces that
default to preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. To reduce <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">digital
fingerprints</a>, share common settings across requesting party
implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum on wire protocols, use
encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to standard lengths.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Service Privacy</h2>
      <p>
The ability for a controller to optionally state at least one <a>service endpoint</a>
in the <a>DID document</a> increases their control and agency. Each additional
endpoint in the <a>DID document</a> adds privacy risk either due to correlation
(e.g., across endpoint descriptions) or because the <a>services</a> are not
protected by an authorization mechanism, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
The degree of additional privacy risk caused by using multiple <a>service
endpoints</a> in one <a>DID document</a> can be difficult to estimate. Privacy
harms are typically unintended consequences. <a>DIDs</a> can identify documents,
<a>services</a>, schemas, and other things that may be associated
with individual people, households, clubs, and employers &mdash; and
correlation of their <a>service endpoints</a> could become a powerful
surveillance and inference tool.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DID documents</a> are often public and will be stored and indexed efficiently by
their very standards-based nature. This risk is worse if <a>DID documents</a> are
published to immutable Verifiable Data Registries. Access to a history of the
<a>DID documents</a> referenced by a <a>DID</a> represents a form of traffic analysis made
more efficient through the use of standards.
      </p>
      <p>
Examples of <a>service endpoints</a> in <a>DID documents</a> come in three broad categories:
      </p>
      <ol>
          <li>
Intentional public disclosures
          </li>
          <li>
<a>DIDs</a> about natural persons (as might be covered by GDPR and similar
privacy regulations)
          </li>
          <li>
<a>DIDs</a> about things and documents that are associated with natural persons
          </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
For the first category, consider non-DID publication mechanisms with only
a single <a>service endpoint</a>. In some cases, the publication mechanism might
reference a <a>DID Document</a> with no <a>service endpoints</a> at all. For the second
category, prefer using only one <a>service</a> that points to an authorization server,
mediator, or proxy that can provide herd privacy. For the third category,
avoid the use of multiple <a>service endpoints</a> for a <a>DID</a> because some
of these (e.g., an authorization server) are likely to be reused with other,
related <a>DIDs</a>. Place correlatable <a>service endpoints</a> behind a
privacy-preserving  mechanism, if possible, or introduce a mediator or proxy
as a sole <a>service endpoint</a> in order to obscure related devices and documents
through herd privacy.

      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions about DID Identification</h1>
    <section>
    <h1>What types of resources can a DID identify?</h1>
    <p>
  Since a <a>DID</a> is a specific type of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier),
  the answer to this question is provided by section 1.1 of the URI
  specification [[!RFC3986]]:
    </p>
<blockquote>
    This specification does not limit the scope of what might be a resource;
    rather, the term "resource" is used in a general sense for whatever might be
    identified by a URI.  Familiar examples include an electronic document, an
    image, a source of information with a consistent purpose (e.g., "today's
    weather report for Los Angeles"), a service (e.g., an HTTP-to-SMS gateway),
    and a collection of other resources.  A resource is not necessarily
    accessible via the Internet; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound
    books in a library can also be resources.  Likewise, abstract concepts can
    be resources, such as the operators and operands of a mathematical equation,
    the types of a relationship (e.g., "parent" or "employee"), or numeric
    values (e.g., zero, one, and infinity).
</blockquote>
  <p>
  In other words, it does not matter whether a resource is “on” or “off” the
  Internet—if it can be identified, it can be assigned a URI, and therefore it
  can be assigned a <a>DID</a>.
  </p>
    </section>
    <section>
  <h1>How do you know what a DID identifies?</h1>
  <p>
  For any <a>DID</a>, the <a>DID controller</a> determines the <a>DID subject</a>.
  It is not expected to be possible to determine the <a>DID subject</a>
  from looking at the <a>DID</a> itself. The reason is that, in order to satisfy
  several core properties of a <a>DID</a> as an identifier—especially
  decentralization and cryptographic verifiability—<a>DIDs</a> are generally
  only meaningful to machines, not humans. To illustrate, compare the following
  two URIs:
  </p>
    <p>
       <code>https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/WorkMode/getting-started</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1j</code>
    </p>
    <p>
    The first is the URL of the Getting Started page of the W3C DID Working
    Group. This is a human-meaningful identifier (at least to someone who
    understands the English language). In this sense, the reader can be said to
    “know” what the URL identifies without having to dereference it (provided
    the reader trusts the publisher of the URL).
    </p>
  <p>
  The second URI—the example <a>DID</a>—is meaningless to humans no matter what
  language you speak. What it identifies is anyone’s guess in the absence of
  further information describing the <a>DID subject</a>. So further information
  about the <a>DID subject</a> is only discoverable by resolving the <a>DID</a>
  to the <a>DID document</a>, obtaining a verifiable credential about the
  <a>DID</a>, or via some other description of the <a>DID</a>.
  </p>
        </section>
        <section>
    <h1>Does the DID identify the DID document?</h1>
    <p>
    No. To be very precise, the <a>DID</a> identifies the <a>DID subject</a> and
    <em>resolves to</em> the <a>DID document</a> (by following the protocol
    specified by the <a>DID method</a>). The <a>DID document</a> is not a
    separate resource from the <a>DID subject</a> and does not have a URI
    separate from the <a>DID</a>. Rather the <a>DID document</a> is an artifact
    of <a>DID resolution</a> controlled by the <a>DID controller</a> for the
    purpose of describing the <a>DID subject</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    This distinction is illustrated by the graph model shown below.
    </p>

              <a>DID document</a> that describes the <a>DID subject</a>. The
              <a>DID document</a> is an artifact of <a>DID resolution</a> and

    <h1>What does the DID document say about the DID subject?</h1>
    <p>
    Each property in a <a>DID document</a> is a statement by the
    <a>DID controller</a> that refers to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        The string of characters defining identifiers for the <a>DID subject</a>
        (e.g., the <code><a>id</a></code> and <code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code>
        properties)
        </li>
        <li>
        How to interact with the <a>DID subject</a> (e.g., the
        <code><a>verificationMethod</a></code> and <code><a>service</a></code>
        properties).
        </li>
        <li>
        How to interpret the specific representation of the <a>DID document</a>
        (e.g., the <code>@context</code> property for a JSON-LD representation).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    There is only one required property in a <a>DID document</a>—the <code><a>id</a></code>
    property—so that is the only statement guaranteed to be in a <a>DID document</a>.
    That statement is illustrated by the solid red arrow in figure 2 asserting
    that the <a>DID</a> identifies the <a>DID subject</a>.
    </p>
        </section>
        <section>
    <h1>How can you discover more information about the DID subject?</h1>
    <p>
    There are two basic options for discovery of more information about the
    <a>DID subject</a>. The first option is to request more information from a
    <a>service endpoint</a> if one or more are present in the <a>DID document</a>.
    An example would be to query a <a>service endpoint</a> that supports
    verifiable credentials for one or more claims (attributes) describing the
    <a>DID subject</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    A second option is to use the <code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> property if it
    is present in the <a>DID document</a>. The <a>DID controller</a> can use it
    to provide a list of other URIs (including other <a>DIDs</a>) that identify
    the same <a>DID subject</a>. Resolving or dereferencing these URIs might yield
    other descriptions or representations of the <a>DID subject</a> as
    illustrated in the figure below.
    </p>

          " >
          <figcaption>
              A <a>DID document</a> can use the alsoKnownAs property to assert
              another URI (including another <a>DID</a>) that identifies the
              same <a>DID subject</a>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
    <p>
    This mechanism is how DID identification can fulfill guidance from the W3C
    in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/">Cool URIs for the Semantic Web</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Given only a URI, machines and people should be able to retrieve a
        description about the resource identified by the URI from the Web. Such
        a look-up mechanism is important to establish shared understanding of
        what a URI identifies. Machines should get RDF data and humans should
        get a readable representation, such as HTML.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    Note that it is not required that a <a>DID document</a> use an
    RDF-based representation; see <a href="#representations"></a>.
    </p>
        </section>
        <section>
    <h2>Can the DID document serve as a representation of the DID subject?</h2>
    <p>
    If the <a>DID subject</a> is a digital resource that can be retrieved
    from the Internet, then yes, the <a>DID document</a> can serve as a
    representation of the <a>DID subject</a>. For example, a data schema that
    needs a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier could be
    assigned a <a>DID</a>, and its <a>DID document</a> could be used as a
    standard way to retrieve a representation of that schema.
    </p>
        <p>
        Alternately, a <a>DID</a> can be used to identify a digital resource
        that can be returned directly from a <a>verifiable data registry</a> if
        that functionality is supported by the applicable <a>DID method</a>.
        </p>
        </section>
        <section>
    <h1>Can existing web resources also be assigned DIDs?</h1>
    <p>
    Yes, if the controller of a web page or any other web resource wants to
    assign it a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier, the
    controller can give it a <a>DID</a>. For example, the author of a blog
    hosted by a blog hosting company (under that hosting company’s own URL)
    could create a <a>DID</a> for the blog. In the <a>DID document</a>, the
    author can include an alsoKnownAs property pointing to the current URL of
    the blog:
    </p>
    <code>
        "alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.blogging-host.example/home"]
    </code>
    <p>
    If the author subsequently moves the blog to a different hosting company
    (or to the author’s own domain), the author can update the <a>DID document</a>
    to point to the new URL for the blog:
    </p>
    <code>
        "alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.example/"]
    </code>
    <p>
    The <a>DID</a> effectively adds a layer of indirection for the blog URL.
    This layer of indirection is under the control of the author instead of
    under the control of an external administrative authority such as the blog
    hosting company. This is how a <a>DID</a> can effectively function as an
    enhanced <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141">URN (Uniform Resource
    Name)</a>—a persistent identifier for an information resource whose network
    location might change over time.
    </p>

    <section>
    <h1>What is the relationship between DID controllers and DID subjects?</h1>
    <p>
    To avoid confusion, it is helpful to classify
    <a>DID subject</a>s into two disjoint sets based on their relationship to
    the <a>DID controller</a>.
    </p>
        <section>
    <h2>Set #1: The DID subject <em>is</em> the DID controller</h2>
    <p>
    The first case, shown in figure 4, is the common scenario where the
    <a>DID subject</a> is also the <a>DID controller</a>. This is the case when
    an individual or organization creates a <a>DID</a> to self-identify.
    </p>
        <figure id="controller-subject-equivalence">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 75%;"
            src="diagrams/figure-b.1-controller-and-subject-equivalence.png" alt="
            Diagram showing the same graph model as figure 2 except with an
            equivalence arc from the DID subject to the DID controller.
          " >
          <figcaption>
              The <a>DID subject</a> is the same entity as the <a>DID controller</a>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
    <p>
    From a graph model perspective, even though the nodes identified as the
    <a>DID controller</a> and <a>DID subject</a> in figure 4 are distinct,
    there is a logical arc connecting them to express a semantic equivalence
    relationship (in RDF/OWL, this is expressed using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#sameAs-def"><code>owl:sameAs</code> predicate)</a>.
    </p>
        </section>
        <section>
    <h2>Set #2: The DID subject is <em>not</em> the DID controller</h2>
    <p>
    The second case is when the <a>DID subject</a> is a separate entity from the
    <a>DID controller</a>. This is the case when, for example, a parent creates
    and maintains control of a <a>DID</a> for a child; a corporation creates and
    maintains control of a <a>DID</a> for a subsidiary; or a manufacturer
    creates and maintains control of a <a>DID</a> for a product, an IoT device,
    or a digital file.
    </p>
    <p>
    From a graph model perspective, the only difference from Set 1 that there is
    no equivalence arc relationship between the <a>DID subject</a> and
    <a>DID controller</a> nodes.
    </p>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h1>Can a DID document have multiple DID Controllers?</h1>
    <p>
    Yes. A <a>DID document</a> might have more than one <a>DID controller</a>. In
    this situation there are two basic options available for how control can be
    shared.
    </p>
        <section>
    <h2>Option #1: Independent Control</h2>
    <p>
    In the first option, shown in the figure below, each of the <a>DID controllers</a>
    might act on its own, i.e., each one has full power to update the
    <a>DID document</a> independently. From a graph model perspective, in this
    configuration:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        Each additional <a>DID controller</a> is another distinct graph node
        (which might be identified by its own <a>DID</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
        The same arcs (“controls” and “controller”) exist between each
        <a>DID controller</a> and the <a>DID document</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <figure id="independent-did-controllers">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 75%;"
            src="diagrams/figure-c.1-independent-did-controllers.png" alt="
            Diagram showing three DID controllers each with an independent
            control relationship with the DID document
          " >
          <figcaption>
              Multiple independent <a>DID controllers</a> that can each act
              independently
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </section>
        <section>
    <h2>Option #2: Group Control</h2>
    <p>
    In the second option, the <a>DID controllers</a> are expected to act together in some
    fashion, such as when using a cryptographic algorithm that requires multiple
    digital signatures (“multi-sig”) or a threshold number of digital
    signatures (“m-of-n”). From a functional standpoint, this option is similar
    to a single <a>DID controller</a> because, although each of the
    <a>DID controllers</a> in the <a>DID controller</a> group has its own graph
    node, the actual control collapses into a single logical graph node
    representing the <a>DID controller</a> group as shown in this figure:
    </p>
        <figure id="group-did-controllers">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 75%;"
            src="diagrams/figure-c.2-group-did-controllers.png" alt="
            Diagram showing how three DID controllers act together as a single
            DID controller group to control a DID document
          " >
          <figcaption>
              Multiple <a>DID controllers</a> who are expected to act together as a
              <a>DID controller</a> group
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
    <p>
    This configuration will often apply when the <a>DID subject</a> is an
    organization, corporation, government agency, community, or other group
    that is not controlled by a single individual.
