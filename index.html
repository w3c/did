<a>Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for
verifiable, decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers
are designed to enable the controller of a <a>DID</a> to prove control over
it and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry,
identity provider, or certificate authority. <a>DIDs</a> are URLs that relate
a <a>DID subject</a> to means for trustable interactions with that subject by way
of a <a>DID document</a>. <a>DID documents</a> are simple documents that describe how
to use that specific <a>DID</a>. Each <a>DID document</a> may express cryptographic
material, verification methods, and/or <a>service endpoints</a>. These provide
a set of mechanisms which enable a <a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the
<a>DID</a>. <a>Service endpoints</a> enable trusted interactions with the <a>DID
subject</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
This document specifies a common data model, a URL format, and a set of operations for
<a>DIDs</a>, DID documents, and DID methods.

    <h1>
Introduction
    </h1>

      <p>
Conventional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management">identity
management</a> systems are based on centralized authorities such as
corporate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_service">directory
services</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate
authorities</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry">domain name
registries</a>. From the standpoint of cryptographic trust
verification, each of these centralized authorities serves as its own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_anchor">root of
trust</a>. To make identity management work across these systems
requires implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity">federated identity
management</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
The emergence of <a>distributed ledger technology</a> (DLT), sometimes
referred to as <a>blockchain technology</a>, provides the opportunity for
fully <a>decentralized identity management</a>. In a decentralized
identity system, entities (in the sense of discrete identifiable units
such as &mdash; but not limited to &mdash; people, organizations, and
things) are free to use any shared root of trust.
Globally distributed ledgers, decentralized P2P networks, or other systems
with similar capabilities, provide the means for managing a root of
trust without introducing a centralized authority or a single point of
failure. In combination, <a>DLTs</a> and <a>decentralized identity management</a>
systems enable any entity to create and manage their own identifiers on any
number of distributed, independent roots of trust.
      </p>

      <p>
Entities are identified by <a>decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs), and
may authenticate via proofs (e.g., digital signatures,
privacy-preserving biometric protocols, etc.). <a>DIDs</a> point to <a>DID
documents</a>. A <a>DID document</a> contains a set of <a>service endpoints</a>
for interacting with the entity the <a>DID</a> identifies (aka the <a>DID
subject</a>). Following the dictums of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design">Privacy by
Design</a>, any entity may have as many <a>DIDs</a> as necessary (and
corresponding <a>DID documents</a> and <a>service endpoints</a>), to respect the
entityâ€™s desired separation of identities, personas, and contexts
(in the everyday sense of these words).
      </p>

      <p>
<a>DID methods</a> are the mechanism by which a <a>DID</a> and its associated <a>DID
document</a> are created, read, updated, and deactivated on a specific
<a>distributed ledger</a> or network. <a>DID methods</a> are defined using separate
<a>DID method</a> specifications.
      </p>

      <p>
This design eliminates dependence on centralized registries for
identifiers as well as centralized certificate authorities for key
management &mdash; the standard pattern in hierarchical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">PKI
(public key infrastructure</a>). In cases where the <a>DID registry</a>
is a <a>distributed ledger</a>, each entity may serve as its own root authority
&mdash; an architecture referred to as
<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">DPKI
(decentralized PKI)</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
Note that <a>DID methods</a> may also be developed for identifiers
registered in federated or centralized identity management systems.
For their part, all types of identifier systems may add support for
<a>DIDs</a>. This creates an interoperability bridge between the worlds of
centralized, federated, and <a>decentralized identifiers</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
The first purpose of this specification is to define the generic
<a>DID scheme</a> and a generic set of operations on <a>DID documents</a> that
can be implemented for any <a>DID registry</a>. The second
purpose of this specification is to
define the conformance requirements for a <a>DID method</a>
specification &mdash; a separate specification that defines a specific <a>DID
scheme</a> and specific set of <a>DID document</a> operations for a specific
<a>DID registry</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
Conceptually, the relationship of this specification and a <a>DID
method</a> specification is similar to the relationship of the IETF
generic <a>URI</a> specification ([[RFC3986]]) and a specific <a>URI</a> scheme
          ([[IANA-URI-SCHEMES]] (such as the http: and https: schemes
specified in [[RFC7230]]). It is also similar to the relationship
of the IETF generic URN specification ([[RFC8141]]) and a specific URN
namespace definition (such as the <a>UUID</a> URN namespace defined in
[[RFC4122]]). The difference is that a <a>DID method</a> specification, in
addition to defining a specific <a>DID scheme</a>, also specifies the
methods for resolving and deactivating <a>DIDs</a> on, and writing <a>DID
documents</a> to, the appropriate <a>DID registry</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
The hierarchical design of a generic <a>DID</a> specification with specific <a>DID method</a>
specifications introduces some of the same concepts as the <a>URI</a> specification:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
<a>DIDs</a> from different <a>DID methods</a> may not be interoperable, just as
<a>URIs</a> from different URI schemes may not be interoperable.
          </li>
          <li>
Entities may need multiple <a>DIDs</a> to support different relationships, as the other
party may only support certain <a>DID methods</a>, just as some browsers may only
support certain URI schemes.
          </li>
          <li>
Entities may need multiple <a>DIDs</a> to support the different cryptographic schemes
of different <a>DID methods</a>, as not all parties will support the same cryptographic
schemes, just as not all browsers support the same URI schemes.
          </li>
          <li>
Managing multiple <a>DIDs</a>, and tracking which <a>DID</a> belongs to which relationship,
under which cryptographic scheme, introduces similar logistical challenges as
managing multiple web addresses and tracking which address belongs to which
website, or tracking which email address belongs to which relationship.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>

see the DID Method Registry [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]].

    <h2>
A Simple Example
    </h2>

    <p>
A <a>DID</a> is a simple text string that consists of three parts: 1) the URL scheme
identifier (<code>did</code>), 2) the identifier for the
<a>DID method</a>, and 3) the DID method-specific identifier.
    </p>

did:example:123456789abcdefghi

    <p>
The <a>DID</a> above resolves to a <a>DID document</a>. A <a>DID document</a>
contains information associated with the <a>DID</a> such as ways to cryptographically
authenticate the entity in control of the <a>DID</a>, as well as services that can be
used to interact with the entity.

      <h3>Interoperability</h3>
          <p>Interoperability of implementations for <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> will be tested by evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> that conform to the specification. Interoperability for <a>DID methods</a> will be determined by evaluating each <a>DID method</a>'s specification to determine, at a minimum, </p>
          <ol>
              <li> the <a>DID method</a> name is unique and not used by an existing, incompatible <a>DID method</a>, </li>
              <li> the required operations are supported,</li>
              <li> operations requiring descriptions are described,</li>
              <li> the specification is specific, detailed, and complete enough for independent implementation, and</li>
              <li> the specification contains sections describing security and privacy considerations.</li>
          </ol>


          <p>Interoperability for producers and consumers of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> is provided by ensuring the <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> conform. Interoperability for method specifications is provided by the details in each method specification. It is understood that, just like a web browser is not required to implement all known URI schemes, conformant software that works with <a>DIDs</a> is not required to implement all known <a>DID methods</a>. However, all implementations of a given <a>DID method</a> must be interoperable for that method.</p>

Data Model
    </h1>
    <p>
This section outlines the <a>decentralized identifier</a> data model concepts,
in particular how keys, services, and the <a>DID subject</a> are related to the
<a>DID document</a>.

Identifier
      </h2>
      <p>
Identifiers are used in the data model to identify specific instances of people,
organizations, devices, keys, services, and things in general. Identifiers are
typically URLs, or more generally, <a>URIs</a>. Non-URI based identifiers are not
advised as, while the data model supports them, they tend to not be easy to
use with other Internet-based identifiers.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>
DID Document
      </h2>
     <p>
A <a>DID document</a> is the resource that is associated with a <a>decentralized
identifier</a> (DID). The <a>DID document</a> typically expresses verification methods (such
as public keys) and services that can be used to interact with a
<a>DID controller</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> is serialized according to a particular syntax (see
<a href="#did-document-syntax"></a>). The <a>DID</a> itself is
contained in the <code>id</code> property.
      </p>
      <p>
The properties that can be present in a <a>DID document</a> are detailed
further in <a href="#did-documents"></a>.

      <h2>
Cryptographic Keys and Other Verification Methods
      </h2>
      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> can express cryptographic keys and other verification methods
that can be used to authenticate or authorize interactions with the <a>DID subject</a>
or associated parties. The information expressed often includes globally
unambiguous identifiers and public key material which can be used to verify
digital signatures. Other information can be expressed such as status
information for the key, such as if it has been suspended or revoked, or other
attributes that enable one to determine whether it is a hardware-backed
cryptographic key.

      <p>
With respect to cryptographic key material, <a href="#public-keys"></a> can be
included in a <a>DID document</a> using, for example, the <code>publicKey</code>
or <code>authentication</code> properties depending on what they are to be used
for. Each public key has an identifier (<code>id</code>) of its own, a
<code>type</code>, and a <code>controller</code>, as well as other properties
which depend on what type of key it is.

Services
      </h2>
      <p>
<a>Service endpoints</a> are used in <a>DID documents</a> to express ways in which one can
communicate with the <a>DID subject</a> or associated entities. Services listed
in the <a>DID document</a> can contain information about privacy preserving messaging
services, or more public information such as social media accounts, personal
websites, and email addresses. The metadata associated with services are often
service specific. For example, the metadata associated with an encrypted
messaging service can express how to initiate the encrypted link before
messaging begins.
      </p>

      <p>
Pointers to services are expressed using the <code>service</code> property.
Each service has its own <code>id</code> and <code>type</code>, as well as a
<code>serviceEndpoint</code> with a <a>URI</a> or further properties describing the
service.

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
    </h1>

    <p>
The concept of a globally unique <a>decentralized identifier</a> is not
new; <a>Universally
Unique Identifiers</a> (UUIDs) were first developed in the 1980s and
later became a standard feature of the Open Software Foundationâ€™s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Computing_Environment">Distributed
Computing Environment</a>. <a>UUIDs</a> achieve global uniqueness without a
centralized registry service by using an algorithm that generates
128-bit values with sufficient entropy that the chance of collision are
infinitesimally small. <a>UUIDs</a> are formally specified in [[RFC4122]] as a
specific type of Unified Resource Name (URN).
    </p>

    <p>
A <a>DID</a> is similar to a <a>UUID</a> except: (a) like a URL, it can be resolved
or dereferenced to a standard resource describing the subject (a <a>DID
document</a> &mdash; see Section <a href="#did-documents"></a>), and (b) unlike
a URL, the <a>DID document</a> typically contains cryptographic material that
enables authentication of the <a>DID subject</a>.

      <h2>
Generic DID Syntax
      </h2>

      <p>
The generic <a>DID scheme</a> is a URI scheme conformant with
[[!RFC3986]]. The <a>DID scheme</a> specializes only the scheme and
authority components of a <a>DID URL</a> &mdash; the <code>path-abempty</code>,
<code>query</code>, and <code>fragment</code> components are
identical to the ABNF rules defined
in [[!RFC3986]].
      </p>

      <p class="note">
The term <a>DID</a> refers only to the <a>URI</a>
conforming to the <code>did</code> rule in the ABNF below. A
<a>DID</a> always identifies the <a>DID subject</a>. The term <a>DID URL</a>,
defined by the <code>did-url</code> rule,
refers to a URL that begins with a <a>DID</a> followed by one or more
additional components. A <a>DID URL</a> always identifies the resource to
be located.
      </p>

      <p>
The following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [[!RFC5234]]
which defines <code>ALPHA</code> and <code>DIGIT</code>. All other
rule names not defined in this ABNF are defined in [[RFC3986]].
      </p>

      <p class="issue" data-number="34">
The grammar currently allows an empty <code>method-specific-id</code>,
e.g., <code>did:example:</code> would be a valid <a>DID</a> that could identify

      <h2>
Generic DID Parameter Names
      </h2>

      <p>
<a>DID URL</a> syntax supports a simple, generalized format for parameters based on the
matrix parameter syntax ([[MATRIX-URIS]]).
The ABNF above does not specify any parameter names (the <code>param-name</code>
rule).
      </p>
      <p>
Some generic DID parameter names (e.g., for service selection) are completely
independent of any specific <a>DID method</a> and MUST always function the same way
for all <a>DIDs</a>.
Others (e.g., for versioning) MAY be supported by
certain <a>DID methods</a>, but MUST operate uniformly across those <a>DID methods</a>
that do support them.
      </p>
      <p>
Parameter names that are completely method-specific are covered in
<a href="#method-specific-did-parameter-names"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
The following table defines a set of generic DID parameter names:
      </p>

      <table class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Generic DID Parameter Name</th>

protection, as specified in [[HASHLINK]].
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
<code>service</code>

          <tr>
            <td>
<code>version-id</code>

            <td>
Identifies a specific version of a <a>DID document</a> to be resolved (the version ID
could be sequential, or a <a>UUID</a>, or method-specific). Note: This parameter may

      <p>
The exact processing rules for these parameters are specified in [[DID-RESOLUTION]].
      </p>

      <p class="note">
Note that there may be additional parameters or options that are not part
of the DID URL but instead passed to a <a>DID resolver</a> "out of band", i.e.,
using a resolution protocol or some other mechanism. Such options could
for example control caching or the desired format of a resolution result.
This is similar to HTTP, where caching or result format are expressed as
HTTP headers rather than as part of an HTTP URL. The important distinction
is that DID parameters that are part of the <a>DID URL</a> specify what resource
is being identified, whereas <a>DID resolver</a> options that are not part of the
<a>DID URL</a> control how that resource is dereferenced.

      <h2>
Method-Specific DID Parameter Names
      </h2>

      <p>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MAY specify additional method-specific parameter
names. A method-specific parameter name MUST be prefixed by the method name
as defined by the <code>method-name</code> rule.
      </p>

      <p>
For example, if the method <code>did:foo:</code> defines the parameter bar,
the parameter name must be <code>foo:bar</code>. An example <a>DID URL</a> using
this method and this method-specific parameter would be:
      </p>

      <p>
<code>did:foo:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;foo:bar=high</code>
      </p>

      <p class="issue" data-number="35">
Consider using kebab-case style instead of colon separator,
e.g., <code>foo-bar</code> instead of <code>foo:bar</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
A method-specific parameter name defined by one <a>DID method</a> MAY
be used by other <a>DID methods</a>. For example:
      </p>

      <p>
<code>did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;foo:bar=low</code>
      </p>

      <p>
Method-specific parameter names MAY be combined with generic parameter
names in any order.
      </p>

      <p>
<code>did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;service=agent;foo:bar=high</code>
      </p>

      <p>
Both <a>DID method</a> namespaces and method-specific parameter
namespaces MAY include colons, so they may be partitioned hierarchically
as defined by a <a>DID method</a> specification. Here is an example <a>DID
URL</a> that illustrates both:
      </p>

      <p>
<code>did:foo:baz:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;foo:baz:hex=b612</code>
      </p>

Path
      </h2>

      <p>
A generic <a>DID path</a> is identical to a URI path and MUST
conform to the <code>path-abempty</code> ABNF rule in [[!RFC3986]]. A
<a>DID path</a> SHOULD be used to address resources available via a
<a>service endpoint</a>. See Section <a href="#service-endpoints"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
A specific <a>DID scheme</a> MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID paths</a> that are
more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.

      <p>
A generic <a>DID query</a> is identical to a URI query and MUST

<a>DID query</a> SHOULD be used to address resources available via a
<a>service endpoint</a>. See Section <a href="#service-endpoints"></a>.

      <h2>
Fragment
      </h2>

      <p>
A generic <a>DID fragment</a> is identical to a URI
fragment and MUST conform to the <code>fragment</code> ABNF rule in
[[RFC3986]]. Implementers are strongly discouraged from using a <a>DID fragment</a>
for anything other than a method-independent
reference into the <a>DID document</a> to identify a component of a <a>DID
document</a> (e.g., a unique <a>public key description</a> or <a>service endpoint</a>). To resolve
this reference, the complete <a>DID URL</a> including the <a>DID fragment</a> MUST be used as
input to the <a>DID URL</a> dereferencing algorithm (see [[DID-RESOLUTION]]) for the
target component in the <a>DID document</a> object.
      </p>

      <p>
A specific <a>DID scheme</a> MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID fragments</a> that
are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
      </p>

      <p>
Implementations need not rely on graph-based processing of <a>DID documents</a>
to locate metadata contained in the <a>DID document</a> when the <a>DID</a> includes
a <a>DID fragment</a>. Tree-based processing can be used instead.
      </p>

      <p>
Implementations SHOULD NOT prevent the use of <a>JSON Pointer</a> ([[!RFC6901]]).

Normalization

For the broadest interoperability, <a>DID</a> normalization should be as
simple and universal as possible. Therefore:
      </p>

      <ol start="1">
        <li>
The did: scheme name MUST be lowercase.
        </li>

        <li>
The method name MUST be lowercase.

        <li>
Case sensitivity and normalization of the value of the
<code>method-specific-id</code> rule in Section <a href="#generic-did-syntax">
          </a> MUST be defined by the governing <a>DID method</a> specification.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Persistence
      </h2>

      <p>
A <a>DID</a> is expected to be persistent and immutable, i.e., bound exclusively
and permanently to its one and only subject. Even after a <a>DID</a> has been
deactivated, it is intended that it never be repurposed.
      </p>

      <p>
Ideally a <a>DID</a> would be a completely
abstract decentralized identifier (like a <a>UUID</a>) that could be bound
to multiple underlying <a>DID registries</a> over time,
thus maintaining its persistence independent of any particular system.
However registering the same identifier on multiple
<a>DID registries</a> introduces extremely hard entityship and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types%23SOA">start-of-authority</a>
(SOA) problems. It also greatly increases implementation complexity
for developers.
      </p>

      <p>
To avoid these issues, it is RECOMMENDED that <a>DID method</a>
specifications only produce <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID methods</a> bound to strong,
stable <a>DID registries</a> capable of making the highest level of
commitment to persistence of the <a>DID</a> and <a>DID method</a> over time.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
Although not included in this version, future versions of this
specification may support a <a>DID document</a> <code>equivID</code> property
to establish verifiable equivalence relations between <a>DIDs</a>
representing the same subject on multiple <a>DID
registries</a>. Such equivalence relations can produce the practical
equivalent of a single persistent abstract <a>DID</a>. See Future Work

      <h2>Contexts</h2>

        <p>
When two software systems need to exchange data, they must use terminology and
a protocol that both systems understand. As an analogy, consider how two
people communicate. Both people must use the same language and the words they
use must mean the same thing to each other. This specification uses the
<code>@context</code> property to express the context of a conversation.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>@context</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>@context</code> property MUST be one or more
<a>URIs</a>, where the value of the first <a>URI</a> is
<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1</code>. If more than one
<a>URI</a> is provided, the <a>URIs</a> MUST be interpreted as an ordered set.
It is RECOMMENDED that dereferencing the <a>URIs</a> results in a document
containing machine-readable information about the context.
          </dd>
        </dl>

      <p>
<a>DID documents</a> MUST include the <code>@context</code> property. The
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD Context</a>
is described in detail in the [[!JSON-LD]] specification. The rules for this
statement are:
      </p>

      <ol start="1">
        <li>
A <a>DID document</a> MUST have exactly one top-level context statement.
        </li>

        <li>
The key for this property MUST be <code>@context</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
The value of this key MUST be the URL for the generic <a>DID</a> context:
<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1</code>.

</pre>
      <p>
<a>DID method</a> specifications MAY define their own JSON-LD contexts.
However it is NOT RECOMMENDED to define a new context unless
necessary to properly implement the method. Method-specific contexts
MUST NOT override the terms defined in the generic <a>DID</a> context.

The rules for a <a>DID subject</a> are:

      <ol start="1">
        <li>
A <a>DID document</a> MUST have exactly one <a>DID subject</a>.

A delegate is an entity, such as a parent or aid organization, that creates and

          </li>
          <li>
A <a>DID document</a> that does not include an

The <code>authorizationCapability</code> field must contain a capability for the
delegate that includes <code>UpdateDidDocument</code> as the capability,
the <a>DID</a> of the delegate as the <code>entity</code>, and MAY include a
more specific set of <code>authentication</code>s that the
delegate MAY use to authenticate when updating the <a>DID document</a>.

          <li>
The delegate <a>DID</a> MUST resolve to a <a>DID document</a> that has a

Public Keys

      <p>
Public keys are used for digital signatures, encryption and other
cryptographic operations, which in turn are the basis for purposes
such as authentication (see Section <a href="#authentication"></a>)
or establishing secure communication with <a>service endpoints</a>
(see Section <a href="#service-endpoints"></a>). In addition, public
keys may play a role in authorization mechanisms of <a>DID</a> CRUD
operations (see Section <a href="#did-operations"></a>). This may be
defined by <a>DID method</a> specifications.
      </p>

      <p>
If a public key does not exist in the <a>DID document</a>, it MUST be
assumed the key has been revoked or is invalid. The <a>DID document</a> MAY
contain revoked keys. A <a>DID document</a> that contains a revoked key MUST
also contain or refer to the revocation information for the key (e.g.,
a revocation list). Each <a>DID method</a> specification is expected to

The algorithm to use when processing a <code>publicKey</code>
property in a <a>DID document</a> is:
      </p>

      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
Let <em>value</em> be the data associated with the
        <code>publicKey</code> property and initialize <em>result</em> to
        <code>null</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
If <em>value</em> is an object, the key material is embedded. Set
        <em>result</em> to <em>value</em>.
        </li>

        <li>
If <em>value</em> is a string, the key is included by reference.
Assume <em>value</em> is a URL.
          <ol>
            <li>
Dereference the URL and retrieve the <code>publicKey</code>
properties associated with the URL (e.g., process the
<code>publicKey</code> property at the top-level of the
dereferenced document).
            </li>

            <li>
Iterate through each public key object.
              <ol>
                <li>
If the <code>id</code> property of the object matches
<em>value</em>, set <em>result</em> to the object.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
If <em>result</em> does not contain at least the <code>id</code>,
<code>type</code>, and <code>controller</code> properties as well as any
mandatory public cryptographic material, as determined by the
<em>result</em>'s <code>type</code> property, throw an error.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="note">
While the <code>controller</code> field may seem redundant in some of the
examples above, keys may be expressed in a <a>DID document</a> where the
controller is described in another <a>DID document</a>. Linked Data Proof
libraries typically expect the <code>controller</code> field to always
exist and may throw an exception if it is missing. Furthermore, per
the requirement that <a>DID documents</a> be interpretable as either a graph
or a tree, a default <code>controller</code> field cannot be inferred by
using a key's position in a tree.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
Caching and expiration of the keys in a <a>DID document</a> is entirely the
responsibility of <a>DID resolvers</a> and other clients. See Section

      <h2>
Authentication
      </h2>

      <p>
Authentication is the mechanism by which the <a>DID controller(s)</a> can
cryptographically prove that they are associated with that DID.
See Section <a href="#binding-of-identity"></a>. Note
that Authentication is separate from Authorization because the
<a>DID controller(s)</a> may wish to enable others to update their DID Document
(for example, to assist with key recovery as discussed in Section
<a href="#key-revocation-and-recovery"></a>) without enabling them to prove
control (and thus be able to impersonate the <a>DID controller(s)</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
The rules for Authentication are:
      </p>

      <ol start="1">
        <li>
A <a>DID document</a> MAY include an <code>authentication</code>
property.
        </li>

        <li>
The value of the <code>authentication</code> property SHOULD be
an array of verification methods.
        </li>

        <li>
Each verification method MAY be embedded or referenced. An example of
a verification method is a public key (see Section <a href="#public-keys"></a>).

      <h2>
Authorization and Delegation
      </h2>

      <p>
Authorization is the mechanism used to state how operations may be
performed on behalf of the <a>DID subject</a>. Delegation is the
mechanism that the subject may use to authorize others to act
on their behalf. Note that Authorization is separate from
Authentication as explained in Section <a href="#authentication"></a>.
This is particularly important for key
recovery in the case of key loss, when the subject no longer has
access to their keys, or key compromise, where the <a>DID controller</a>'s
trusted third parties need to override malicious activity by an attacker. See
Section <a href="#security-considerations"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
Each <a>DID method</a> MUST define how authorization and delegation are
implemented, including any necessary cryptographic operations.
      </p>

      <p>
There are at least two suggested methods for implementing
Authorization and Delegation, which may be layered:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>DID registry</a> could implement a coarse
grained <code>controller</code> pattern by enabling <a>DID documents</a> to
express the <a>DID</a> of another <a>DID controller</a> that controls it, or
additionally,
        </li>

        <li>
A <a>DID registry</a> could implement a
Capabilities-based approach that enables further fine-grained control
of authorization and delegation.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
Example:
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="DID document with a controller property">

      <h2>
Service Endpoints
      </h2>

      <p>
In addition to publication of authentication and authorization
mechanisms, the other primary purpose of a <a>DID document</a> is to enable
discovery of <a>service endpoints</a> for the <a>DID subject</a>. A <a>service
endpoint</a> MAY represent any type of service the <a>DID subject</a> wishes to
advertise, including <a>decentralized identity management</a> services for
further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction. The
rules for <a>service endpoints</a> are:
      </p>

      <ol start="1">
        <li>
A <a>DID document</a> MAY include a <code>service</code> property.
        </li>

        <li>
The value of the <code>service</code> property SHOULD be an array
of <a>service endpoints</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
Each <a>service endpoint</a> SHOULD include an <code>id</code> property.
The array of <a>service endpoints</a> MUST NOT contain multiple entries
with the same <code>id</code>. A <a>DID document</a> processor MUST
produce an error in that case.
        </li>

        <li>
Each service endpoint MUST include <code>type</code> and
<code>serviceEndpoint</code> properties, and MAY include additional
properties.
        </li>

        <li>
The <a>service endpoint</a> protocol SHOULD be published in an open
standard specification.
        </li>

        <li>
The value of the <code>serviceEndpoint</code> property MUST be a
JSON-LD object or a valid <a>URI</a> conforming to [[RFC3986]] and
normalized according to the rules in section 6 of [[RFC3986]] and to
any normalization rules in its applicable URI scheme specification.

      <h2>
Extensibility
      </h2>

      <p>
One of the goals of the <a>decentralized identifiers</a> data model is to
enable permissionless innovation. This requires that the data model
is extensible in a number of different ways:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
The requirement to model complex multi-entity relationships is
provided through the use of a graph-based data model.
        </li>

        <li>
The requirement to enable extending the machine-readable
vocabularies used to describe information in the data model &mdash;
without relying on a centralized system &mdash; is accomplished via
the use of [[LINKED-DATA]].
        </li>

        <li>
The requirement to support multiple types of cryptographic proof
formats is accomplished via the use of Linked Data Proofs
[[LD-PROOFS]], Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]], and a
variety of signature suites.
        </li>

        <li>
The requirement to provide all of the extensibility mechanisms
outlined above in a data format that is popular among software
developers and web page authors is enabled via the use of
[[!JSON-LD]].
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
This approach to data modeling is often called an "open world
assumption", meaning that anyone can say anything about any other
thing. This approach often feels in conflict with building simple
and predictable software systems. Balancing extensibility with
program correctness is always more challenging with an open world
assumption than it is with closed software systems.
      </p>

      <p>
The rest of this section describes how both extensibility and program
correctness are achieved through a series of examples.
      </p>

      <p>
Let us assume that we start with the following <a>DID document</a>:
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple DID document">
{
  "@context": "https://example.org/example-method/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "publicKey": [{ <span class="comment">...</span> }],
  "authentication": [{ <span class="comment">...</span> }],
  "service": [{ <span class="comment">...</span> }]
}
      </pre>
      <p>
The contents of the <code>publicKey</code>,
<code>authentication</code>, and <code>service</code> properties are
not important for the purposes of this section. What is important is
that the object above is a valid <a>DID document</a>. Let's assume
that a developer wanted to extend the <a>DID document</a> to express
an additional piece of information: the subject's public photo
stream.
      </p>

      <p>
The first thing that a developer would do is create a JSON-LD Context
containing the new term:
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="An example JSON-LD Context">
{
  "@context": {
    "PhotoStreamService": "https://example.com/vocab#PhotoStreamService"
  }
}
      </pre>
      <p>
Now that the JSON-LD Context has been created, the developer MUST
publish it somewhere that is accessible to any <a>DID document</a>
processor. For this example, let us assume that the JSON-LD Context
above is published at the following URL:
<code>did:example:contexts:987654321</code>. At this point, extending
the first example in this section is a simple matter of including the
context above and adding the new property to the <a>DID document</a>.
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A DID document with a custom extension">
{
  "@context": "https://example.org/example-method/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "authentication": [ <span class="comment">...</span> ],
  "service": [<span class="highlight">{
    "@context": "did:example:contexts:987654321",
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#photos",
    "type": "PhotoStreamService",
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.org/photos/379283"
  }</span>]
}
      </pre>
      <p>
The examples so far have shown that it is easy to extend the
<a>decentralized identifiers</a> data model in a permissionless and
decentralized way. The mechanism also ensures that <a>decentralized
identifiers</a> created in this way prevent namespace conflicts and
semantic ambiguity.
      </p>

      <p>
An extensibility model that is this dynamic does increase
implementation burden. Software written for such a system will have
to determine if accepting <a>DID document</a>s with extensions is
acceptable based on the risk profile of the application. Some
applications may choose to accept but ignore extensions, others may
choose to only accept certain extensions, while highly secure
environments may disallow extensions. These decisions are up to the
application developers and are specifically not the domain of this
specification.
      </p>

      <p>
Implementations MUST produce an error when an extension JSON-LD
Context overrides the expanded URL for a term specified in this
specification. To avoid the possibility of accidentally overriding
terms, developers SHOULD scope their extensions. For example,
the following extension scopes the new
<code>PhotoStreamService</code> term so that it may only be used
within the <code>service</code> property:
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Scoping terms in a JSON-LD Context">
{
  "@context": {
    <span class="highlight">"service": {
      "@id": "https://w3id.org/did#service",
      "@context": {
        "PhotoStreamService": "https://example.com/vocab#PhotoStreamService"
      }
    }</span>
  }
}
      </pre>
      <p>
Developers are urged to ensure that extension JSON-LD Contexts are
highly available. Implementations that cannot fetch a context will
produce an error. Strategies for ensuring that extension JSON-LD
Contexts are always available include using content-addressed URLs
for contexts, bundling context documents with implementations, or
enabling aggressive caching of contexts.

DID Document Syntax
    </h1>
        <p>
A <a>DID document</a> MUST be a single JSON object conforming to [[!RFC8259]].
Many of the concepts in this document were introduced by example using the
JSON-LD syntax, a format for mapping JSON data into the RDF semantic graph model as defined by
[[!JSON-LD]]. This section formalizes how the data model (described in Sections
<a href="#data-model"></a> and <a href="#did-documents"></a>) is realized in JSON-LD.
        </p>
        <p>
Although syntactic mappings are provided for JSON and JSON-LD only, applications and
services can use any other data representation syntax, such as JXD (JSON XDI Data, a serialization format for
the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/xdi/xdi-core/v1.0/csd01/xdi-core-v1.0-csd01.xml">
XDI graph model</a>), XML, YAML, or CBOR, that is capable of expressing the data model.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>JSON</h3>

        <p>
The data model as described in Section <a href="#data-model"></a> can be
encoded in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) [[RFC8259]] by mapping property
values to JSON types as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Numeric values representable as IEEE754 SHOULD be represented as a Number type.
          </li>
          <li>
Boolean values SHOULD be represented as a Boolean type.
          </li>
          <li>
Sequence value SHOULD be represented as an Array type.
          </li>
          <li>
Unordered sets of values SHOULD be represented as an Array type.
          </li>
          <li>
Sets of properties SHOULD be represented as an Object type.
          </li>
          <li>
Empty values SHOULD be represented as a null value.
          </li>
          <li>
Other values MUST be represented as a String type.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
JSON-LD
      </h2>

      <p>
[[!JSON-LD]] is a JSON-based format used to serialize
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data">Linked Data</a>. The
syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems already using
JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily
intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments,
to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based
storage engines.
      </p>

      <p>
JSON-LD is useful when extending the data model described in this
specification. Instances of the data model are encoded in JSON-LD in the same
way they are encoded in JSON (Section <a href="#json"></a>), with the addition
of the <code>@context</code> property. The
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD Context</a>
is described in detail in the [[!JSON-LD]] specification and its use is
elaborated on in Section <a href="#extensibility"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
In general, the data model and syntaxes described in this document are
designed such that developers can copy and paste examples into their software systems. The design goal of
this approach is to provide a low barrier to entry while still ensuring global
interoperability between a heterogeneous set of software systems. This section
describes some of these approaches, which will likely go unnoticed by most
developers, but whose details will be of interest to implementers.
Noteworthy features provided by JSON-LD are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
The <code>@id</code> and <code>@type</code> keywords are aliased to
<code>id</code> and <code>type</code> respectively, enabling developers to use
this specification as idiomatic JSON.
        </li>
        <li>
Data types, such as integers, dates, units of measure, and URLs, are
automatically typed to provide stronger type guarantees for use cases that
require them.
        </li>
        <li>
The <code>@protected</code> properties feature of JSON-LD 1.1 is used to ensure
that terms defined by this specification cannot be overridden. This means
that as long as the same <code>@context</code> declaration is made at the top
of a <a>DID document</a>, that interoperability is guaranteed between implementations
which use a JSON-LD processor and implementations which do not.

DID Methods
    </h1>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2>
DID Method Schemes
      </h2>

      <p>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST define exactly one specific <a>DID
scheme</a> identified by exactly one method name (the <code>method-name</code> rule in
Section <a href="#generic-did-syntax"></a>).
      </p>

      <p>
Since the method name is part of the <a>DID</a>, it SHOULD be as short as
practical. A method name of five characters or less is RECOMMENDED.
The method name MAY reflect the name of the <a>DID
registry</a> to which the <a>DID method</a> specification applies.
      </p>

      <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification for the specific <a>DID scheme</a> MUST specify
how to generate the <code>method-specific-id</code> component of a <a>DID</a>. The
<code>method-specific-id</code> value MUST be able to be generated without the use
of a centralized registry service. The <code>method-specific-id</code> value SHOULD
be globally unique by itself. The <a>DID</a> as defined by the <code>did</code> rule
in Section <a href="#generic-did-syntax"></a> MUST be globally unique.
      </p>

      <p>
If needed, a specific <a>DID scheme</a> MAY define multiple specific
<code>method-specific-id</code> formats. It is RECOMMENDED that a specific <a>DID
scheme</a> define as few <code>method-specific-id</code> formats as possible.

DID Operations
      </h2>

      <p>
To enable the full functionality of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> on a
particular <a>DID registry</a>, a
<a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how each of the following
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">
CRUD</a> operations is performed by a client. Each operation MUST be
specified to the level of detail necessary to build and test
interoperable client implementations with the target system.
The specification document for a <a>DID method</a> that does not support
specific operations such as Update and Deactivate MUST clearly specify these
limitations. Note that, due to the specified contents of <a>DID documents</a>,
these operations can effectively be used to perform all the operations
required of a CKMS (cryptographic key management system), e.g.,:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Key registration
        </li>

        <li>
Key replacement

Unique DID Method Names

SHOULD use a method name that is unique among all <a>DID method</a>
names known to them at the time of publication.
      </p>
      <p>
Because there is no central authority for allocating or approving <a>DID
method</a> names, there is no way to know for certain if a particular <a>DID method</a>
name is unique. To help with this challenge, the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">W3C Credentials Community
Group</a> maintains a non-authoritative list of known <a>DID

The [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] is a tool for implementors to use when coming
to consensus on a new method name, as well as an informative reference for
software developers implementing <a href="#did-resolvers"></a> for different
<a>DID methods</a>.
The [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] is not a definitive or official list of <a>DID

Security Considerations

    <p>
NOTE TO IMPLEMENTERS: During the Implementerâ€™s Draft stage, this
section focuses on security topics that should be important in early
implementations. The editors are also seeking feedback on threats and
threat mitigations that should be reflected in this section or
elsewhere in the spec. As the root identifier records for <a>decentralized
identifiers</a> (DIDs) and <a>DID documents</a> are a vital component of
<a>decentralized identity management</a>. They are also the foundational
building blocks of <a>decentralized public key infrastructure</a> (DPKI)
as an augmentation to conventional X.509 certificates. As such, <a>DIDs</a> are
designed to operate under the general Internet threat model used by
many IETF standards. We assume uncompromised endpoints, but allow
messages to be read or corrupted on the network. Protecting against an
attack when a system is compromised requires external key-signing
hardware. See also Section <a href="#key-revocation-and-recovery"></a>
regarding key revocation and recovery. For their part, the <a>DLTs</a> hosting
<a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> have special security properties for preventing
active attacks. Their design uses public/private key cryptography to
allow operation on passively monitored networks without risking
compromise of private keys. This is what makes <a>DID</a> architecture and
decentralized identity possible.

      <h2>
Requirements of DID Method Specifications
      </h2>

      <ol start="1">
        <li>
<a>DID method</a> specifications MUST include their own Security
Considerations sections.
        </li>

        <li>
This section MUST consider all the requirements mentioned in
section 5 of [[RFC3552]] (page 27) for the <a>DID</a> operations defined in
the specification. In particular:
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="issue">
Discussions at Rebooting the Web of Trust 5 resulted in consensus to
move Authorization to <a>DID method</a> specifications. It is currently
expected that there will be an attempt to create a generalized
authorization mechanism that is build on object capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
At least the following forms of attack MUST be considered:
eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and
man-in-the-middle. Potential denial of service attacks MUST be
identified as well. If the protocol incorporates cryptographic
protection mechanisms, it should be clearly indicated which portions
of the data are protected and what the protections are (i.e.,
integrity only, confidentiality, and/or endpoint authentication,
etc.). Some indication should also be given to what sorts of attacks
the cryptographic protection is susceptible. Data which should be
held secret (keying material, random seeds, etc.) should be clearly
labeled. If the technology involves authentication, particularly
user-host authentication, the security of the authentication method
MUST be clearly specified.
      </p>

      <ol start="3">
        <li>
This section MUST also discuss, per Section 5 of [[RFC3552]],
residual risks (such as the risks from compromise in a related
protocol, incorrect implementation, or cipher) after threat
mitigation has been deployed.
        </li>

        <li>
This section MUST provide integrity protection and update
authentication for all operations required by
Section <a href="#did-operations"></a>.
        </li>

        <li>
Where <a>DID methods</a> make use of peer-to-peer computing resources
(such as with all known <a>DLTs</a>), the expected burdens of those
resources SHOULD be discussed in relation to denial of service.
        </li>

        <li>
Method-specific endpoint authentication MUST be discussed. Where
<a>DID methods</a> make use of <a>DLTs</a> with varying network topology, sometimes
offered as "light node" or "<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security">thin client</a>"
implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security
assumptions of the topology available to implementations of the <a>DID
method</a> MUST be discussed.
        </li>

        <li>
<a>DID methods</a> MUST discuss the policy mechanism by which <a>DIDs</a> are
proven to be uniquely assigned. A <a>DID</a> fits the functional definition
of a URN as defined in [[RFC8141]] &mdash; a persistent identifier that is
assigned once to a resource and never reassigned. In a security
context this is particularly important since a <a>DID</a> may be used to
identify a specific party subject to a specific set of authorization
rights.
        </li>

        <li>
<a>DID methods</a> that introduce new authentication <a>service endpoint</a>

        <h3>
Proving Control of a DID and DID Document
        </h3>

        <p>
Signatures are one method to allow <a>DID documents</a> to be
cryptographically verifiable.
        </p>

        <p>
By itself, a verified signature on a self-signed <a>DID document</a> does
not prove control of a <a>DID</a>. It only proves the following:
        </p>

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
The <a>DID document</a> has not been tampered with since it was
registered.
          </li>

          <li>
The <a>DID controller(s)</a> controlled the private key used
for the signature at the time the signature was generated.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
Proving control of a <a>DID</a>, i.e., the binding between the <a>DID</a> and
the <a>DID document</a> that describes it, requires a two step process:
        </p>

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
Resolving the <a>DID</a> to a <a>DID document</a> according to its <a>DID method</a>
specification.
          </li>

          <li>
Verifying that the <code>id</code> property of the resulting <a>DID document</a>
matches the <a>DID</a> that was resolved.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
It should be noted that this process proves control of a <a>DID</a> and
<a>DID document</a> regardless of whether the <a>DID document</a> is signed.
        </p>

        <p>
Signatures on <a>DID documents</a> are optional. <a>DID method</a> specifications
SHOULD explain and specify their implementation if applicable.
        </p>

        <p>
It is RECOMMENDED to combine timestamps with signatures.

      <section>
        <h3>
Proving Control of a Public Key
        </h3>

        <p>
There are two methods for proving control of the private key
corresponding to a <a>public key description</a> in the <a>DID document</a>:
static and dynamic. The static method is to sign the <a>DID document</a>
with the private key. This proves control of the private key at a
time no later than the <a>DID document</a> was registered. If the <a>DID
document</a> is not signed, control of a public key described in the
<a>DID document</a> may still be proven dynamically as follows:
        </p>

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
Send a challenge message containing a <a>public key description</a>
from the <a>DID document</a> and a nonce to an appropriate <a>service
endpoint</a> described in the <a>DID document</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
Verify the signature of the response message against the <a>public
key description</a>.

        <h3>
Authentication and Verifiable Claims
        </h3>

        <p>
A <a>DID</a> and <a>DID document</a> do not inherently carry any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">
PII</a> (personally-identifiable information). The process of
binding a <a>DID</a> to something in the real-world such as a person or company,
for example with credentials with the same subject as that <a>DID</a>, is out
of scope for this specification. However this topic is the focus of the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/vctf/">verifiable claims</a>
standardization work at the W3C (where the term "DID" originated).
        </p>
      </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Authentication Service Endpoints
      </h2>

      <p>
If a <a>DID document</a> publishes a <a>service endpoint</a> intended for
authentication or authorization of the <a>DID subject</a> (section
<a href="#service-endpoints"></a>), it is the responsibility of the <a>service
endpoint</a> provider, subject, and/or relying party to comply with the
requirements of the authentication protocol(s) supported at that
<a>service endpoint</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Non-Repudiation
      </h2>

      <p>
Non-repudiation of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID document</a> updates is supported
under the assumption that: (1) the subject is monitoring for unauthorized
updates (see Section <a href="#notification-of-did-document-changes"></a>)
and (2) the subject has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious updates
according to the <a>DID method</a>'s access control mechanism (section
<a href="#authentication"></a>).
This capability is further supported if timestamps are included (sections
<a href="#created-optional"></a> and <a href="#updated-optional"></a>) and the
target <a>DLT</a> system supports timestamps.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Notification of DID Document Changes
      </h2>

      <p>
One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a <a>DID document</a> is
monitoring and actively notifying the <a>DID subject</a> when there are changes.
This is analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to
the email addresses on file. In the case of a <a>DID</a>, where there is no
intermediary registrar or account provider to generate the
notification, the following approaches are RECOMMENDED:
      </p>

      <ol start="1">
        <li>
Subscriptions. If the <a>DID registry</a> on which the <a>DID</a> is
registered directly supports change notifications, this service can
be offered to <a>DID controllers</a>. Notifications MAY be sent directly to the
relevant <a>service endpoints</a> listed in an existing <a>DID</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
Self-monitoring. A <a>DID subject</a> MAY employ their own local or online
agent to periodically monitor for changes to a <a>DID document</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
Third-party monitoring. A <a>DID subject</a> MAY rely on a third party
monitoring service, however this introduces another vector of attack.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Key and Signature Expiration
      </h2>

      <p>
In a <a>decentralized identifier</a> architecture, there are no centralized
authorities to enforce key or signature expiration policies.
Therefore <a>DID resolvers</a> and other client applications SHOULD validate
that keys were not expired at the time they were used. Since some use cases
may have legitimate reasons why already-expired keys can be extended, a key
expiration SHOULD NOT prevent any further use of the key, and implementations
of a resolver SHOULD be compatible with such extension behavior.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Key Revocation and Recovery
      </h2>

      <p>
Section <a href="#did-operations"></a> specifies the <a>DID</a> operations
that must be supported by a <a>DID method</a> specification, including
deactivation of a <a>DID document</a> by replacing it with an updated <a>DID
document</a>. In general, checking for key revocation on <a>DLT</a>-based
methods is expected to be handled in a manner similar to checking the
balance of a cryptocurrency account on a <a>distributed ledger</a>: if the
balance is empty, the entire <a>DID</a> is deactivated. <a>DID method</a>
specifications SHOULD enable support for a quorum of trusted parties
to enable key recovery. Some of the facilities to do so are suggested
in section 6.5, Authorization. Note that not all <a>DID method</a>
specifications will recognize control from <a>DIDs</a> registered using
other <a>DID methods</a> and they MAY restrict third-party control to <a>DIDs</a>
that use the same method. Access control and key recovery in a <a>DID
method</a> specification MAY also include a time lock feature to protect
against key compromise by maintaining a second track of control for
recovery. Further specification of this type of control is a matter
for future work (see Section <a href="#time-locks-and-did-document-recovery"></a>).

      <h2>
The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers
      </h2>

      <p>
<a>DIDs</a> achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central
registration authority. This comes, however, at the cost of human
memorability. The algorithms capable of generating globally unique
identifiers automatically produce random strings of characters that
have no human meaning. This demonstrates the axiom about
identifiers known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko's
Triangle</a>: "human-meaningful, decentralized, secure &mdash; pick any
two".
      </p>

      <p>
There are of course many use cases where it is desirable to
discover a <a>DID</a> when starting from a human-friendly identifier &mdash; a
natural language name, a domain name, or a conventional address for
a <a>DID controller</a> such as a mobile telephone number, email address,
Twitter handle, or blog URL. However, the problem of mapping
human-friendly identifiers to <a>DIDs</a> (and doing so in a way that can
be verified and trusted) is out-of-scope for this specification.
      </p>

      <p>
Solutions to this problem (and there are many) should be defined in
separate specifications that reference this specification. It is
strongly recommended that such specifications carefully consider:
(a) the numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about
the true human-friendly identifier for a target entity, and (b) the
privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are
inherently correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
A draft specification for discovering a <a>DID</a> from domain names and
e-mail addresses using DNS lookups is available at [[DNS-DID]].

        <h2>
Immutability
        </h2>

        <p>
Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and
the assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Like any ecosystem, the
<a>DID</a> ecosystem has some potential for this to occur. Because this spec is
focused on a data model rather than a protocol, it offers no opinion about
many aspects of how that model is put to use. However, individual <a>DID methods</a>
may wish to consider constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics
they don't need. The more "locked down" a <a>DID method</a> is, while providing the
same set of features, the less it can be manipulated by malicious actors.
        </p>
        <p>
As an example, consider the flexibility that the data model offers with respect
to updating. A single edit to a <a>DID document</a> can change anything and everything except
the root <code>id</code> property of the document &mdash; and any individual JSON object
in the data model can change all of its properties except its <code>id</code>.
But is it actually desirable for a <a>service endpoint</a> to change its <code>type</code>
once it's been defined? Or for a key to change its value? Or would it be better
to require a new <code>id</code> when certain fundamental properties of an
object change? Malicious takeovers of a web site often aim for an outcome where the
site keeps its identifier (the host name), but gets subtle, dangerous changes
underneath. If certain properties of the site were required by spec to be immutable
(e.g., the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">
ASN</a> associated with its IP address), such attacks might be much harder and
more expensive to carry out &mdash; and anomaly detection would be easier.
        </p>
        <p>
The notion that immutability may provide some cybersecurity benefits is particularly
relevant because of caching. For <a>DID methods</a> tied to a global source of truth, a
direct, just-in-time lookup of the latest version of a <a>DID document</a> is always possible.
However, it seems likely that layers of cache might eventually sit between a client
and that source of truth. If they do, believing the attributes of an object in the
<a>DID document</a> to have a given state, when they are actually subtly different, may invite
exploits. This is particularly true if some lookups are of a full <a>DID document</a>,
and others are of partial data, where the larger context is assumed.

    <h1>
Privacy Considerations
    </h1>

    <p>
It is critically important to apply the principles of Privacy by Design
to all aspects of decentralized identifier architecture, because DIDs
and DID Documents are &mdash; by design &mdash; administered directly by
the <a>DID controller(s)</a>.
There is no registrar, hosting company, or other intermediate service
provider to recommend or apply additional privacy safeguards. The
authors of this specification have applied all seven Privacy by Design
principles throughout its development. For example, privacy in this
specification is preventative not remedial, and privacy is an embedded
default. Furthermore, <a>decentralized identifier</a> architecture by itself
embodies principle #7, "Respect for user privacy &mdash; keep it user-centric."
This section lists additional privacy considerations that implementers,
delegates, and <a>DID subjects</a> should bear in mind.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>
Requirements of DID Method Specifications
      </h2>

      <ol start="1">
        <li>
<a>DID method</a> specifications MUST include their own Privacy
Considerations sections, if only to point to the general privacy
considerations in this section.
        </li>

        <li>
The <a>DID method</a> specification's Privacy Considerations section
MUST discuss any subsection of
section 5 of [[RFC6973]] that could apply in a method-specific
manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored data
compromise, unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation,
identification, secondary use, disclosure, exclusion.

      <h2>
Keep Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) Private
      </h2>

      <p>
If a <a>DID method</a> specification is written for a public <a>DID
registry</a> where all <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> will be publicly available,
it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that <a>DID documents</a> contain no PII. All PII
should be kept behind <a>service endpoints</a> under the control
of the <a>DID subject</a>. With this privacy architecture, PII may be exchanged
on a private, peer-to-peer basis using communications channels identified and
secured by <a>public key descriptions</a> in <a>DID documents</a>. This also
enables <a>DID subjects</a> and relying parties to implement the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">right
to be forgotten</a>, as no PII will be written to an immutable
<a>distributed ledger</a>.

      <h2>
DID Correlation Risks and Pseudonymous DIDs
      </h2>

      <p>
Like any type of globally unique identifier, <a>DIDs</a> may be used for
correlation. <a>DID controllers</a> can mitigate this privacy risk by using
pairwise unique <a>DIDs</a>, i.e., by sharing a different private <a>DID</a> for
every relationship. In effect, each <a>DID</a> acts as a pseudonym. A
pseudonymous <a>DID</a> need only be shared with more than one party when
the <a>DID subject</a> explicitly authorizes correlation between those parties.
If pseudonymous <a>DIDs</a> are the default, then the only need for a public
<a>DID</a> &mdash; a <a>DID</a> published openly or shared with a large number of
parties &mdash; is when the <a>DID subject</a> explicitly desires public identification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
DID Document Correlation Risks
      </h2>

      <p>
The anti-correlation protections of pseudonymous <a>DIDs</a> are easily
defeated if the data in the corresponding <a>DID documents</a> can be
correlated. For example, using same <a>public key descriptions</a> or
bespoke <a>service endpoints</a> in multiple <a>DID documents</a> can provide
as much correlation information as using the same <a>DID</a>. Therefore the <a>DID
document</a> for a pseudonymous <a>DID</a> SHOULD also use pairwise-unique
public keys.

It might seem natural to also use pairwise-unique <a>service endpoints</a>
in the <a>DID document</a> for a pseudonymous <a>DID</a>. However, unique
endpoints allow all traffic between to <a>DIDs</a> to be isolated perfectly into
unique buckets, where timing correlation and similar analysis is easy.
Therefore, a better strategy for endpoint privacy may be to share an
endpoint among thousands or millions of <a>DIDs</a> controlled by many different
subjects.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Herd Privacy
      </h2>

      <p>
When a <a>DID subject</a> is indistinguishable from others in the herd, privacy
is available. When the act of engaging privately with another party
is by itself a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished. <a>DIDs</a>
and <a>DID methods</a> SHOULD work to improve herd privacy, particularly for
those who legitimately need it most. Choose technologies and human
interfaces that default to preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. In
order to reduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">digital
fingerprints</a>, share common settings across client
implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum on wire
protocols, use encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to
standard lengths.

Future Work
    </h1>

    <section>
      <h2>
Upper Limits on DID Character Length
      </h2>

      <p>
The current specification does not take a position on maximum length
of a <a>DID</a>. The maximum interoperable URL length is currently about 2K
characters. QR codes can handle about 4K characters. Clients using
<a>DIDs</a> will be responsible for storing many <a>DIDs</a>, and some methods
would be able to externalize some of their costs onto clients by
relying on more complicated signature schemes or by adding state into
<a>DIDs</a> intended for temporary use. A future version of this
specification should set reasonable limits on <a>DID</a> character length to
minimize externalities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Equivalence
      </h2>

      <p>
Including an equivalence property, such as <code>equivID</code>, in <a>DID documents</a>
whose value is an array of <a>DIDs</a> would allow subjects to assert two or
more <a>DIDs</a> that represent the same subject. This capability has
numerous uses, including supporting migration between <a>DID registries</a> and
providing forward compatibility of existing <a>DIDs</a> to future <a>DID
registries</a>. In
theory, equivalent <a>DIDs</a> should have the same identifier rights,
allowing <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vctf/">verifiable claims</a>
made against one <a>DID</a> to apply to equivalent <a>DIDs</a>. Equivalence was not
included in the current specification due to the complexity of
verifying equivalence across different <a>DLTs</a> and different <a>DID
methods</a>, and also of aggregating properties of equivalent <a>DID
documents</a>. However equivalence should be supported in a future
version of this specification.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>
Timestamps
      </h2>

      <p>
Verifiable timestamps have significant utility for identifier
records. This is a good fit for <a>DLTs</a>, since most offer some type of
timestamp mechanism. Despite some transactional cost, they are the
most censorship-resistant transaction ordering systems in the world,
so they are nearly ideal for <a>DID document</a> timestamping. In some cases
a <a>DLT</a>'s immediate timing is approximate, however their sense of
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki%23Abstract">
"median time past" (see Bitcoin BIP 113)</a> can be precisely
defined. A generic <a>DID document</a> timestamping mechanism could would
work across all <a>DLTs</a> and might operate via a mechanism including
either individual transactions or transaction batches. The generic
mechanism was deemed out of scope for this version, although it may
be included in a future version of this specification.

      <h2>
Time Locks and DID Document Recovery
      </h2>

      <p>
Section <a href="#key-revocation-and-recovery"></a> mentions one
possible clever use of time locks to recover control of a <a>DID</a> after a
key compromise. The technique relies on an ability to override the
most recent update to a <a>DID document</a> with Authorization applied by an
earlier version of the <a>DID document</a> in order to defeat the attacker.
This protection depends on adding a <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki%23Abstract">
time lock (see Bitcoin BIP 65)</a> to protect part of the transaction
chain, enabling a Authorization block to be used to recover control.
We plan to add support for time locks in a future version of this
specification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Smart Signatures
      </h2>

      <p>
Not all <a>DLTs</a> can support the Authorization logic in section 6.5.
Therefore, in this version of the specification, all Authorization
logic MUST be delegated to <a>DID method</a> specifications. A potential
future solution is a <a href="http://www.weboftrust.info/downloads/smart-signatures.pdf">Smart
Signature</a> specification that specifies the code any conformant
<a>DLT</a> may implement to process signature control logic.

      <h2>
Verifiable Claims
      </h2>

      <p>
Although <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> form a foundation for decentralized
identity, they are only the first step in describing their subjects. The
rest of the descriptive power comes through collecting and
selectively using <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vctf/">verifiable
claims</a>. Future versions of the specification will describe in
more detail how <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID document</a> can be integrated with &mdash; and help
enable &mdash; the verifiable claims ecosystem.

      <h2>
Alternate Serializations and Graph Models
      </h2>

      <p>
This version of the specification relies on JSON-LD and the RDF graph
model for expressing a <a>DID document</a>. Future versions of this
specification MAY specify other semantic graph formats for a <a>DID
document</a>, such as JXD (JSON XDI Data), a serialization format for the
XDI graph model as defined by the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/xdi/xdi-core/v1.0/csd01/xdi-core-v1.0-csd01.xml">
