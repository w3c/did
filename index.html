    <p>
<a>Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A <a>DID</a> identifies any
subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)
that the controller of the <a>DID</a> decides that it identifies. In contrast to
typical, federated identifiers, <a>DIDs</a> have been designed so that they may
be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate
authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the
discovery of information related to a <a>DID</a>, the design enables the
controller of a <a>DID</a> to prove control over it without requiring permission
from any other party. <a>DIDs</a> are <a>URIs</a> that associate a <a>DID
subject</a> with a <a>DID document</a> allowing trustable interactions
associated with that subject.
    </p>
    <p>
Each <a>DID document</a> can express cryptographic material, <a>verification
methods</a>, or <a>services</a>, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a
<a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the <a>DID</a>. <a>Services</a> enable
trusted interactions associated with the <a>DID subject</a>. A <a>DID</a> might
provide the means to return the <a>DID subject</a> itself, if the <a>DID
subject</a> is an information resource such as a data model.
    </p>
    <p>
This document specifies the DID syntax, a common data model, core properties,
serialized representations, DID operations, and an explanation of the process
of resolving DIDs to the resources that they represent.

    <p>
The W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group has published this document as a
W3C Candidate Recommendation and is requesting that software developers and DID
Method specification authors provide experimental implementations designed to
test the implementability of all of the features in this document.
    </p>

    <p>
To exit the W3C Candidate Recommendation phase, the W3C DID Working Group will
require two things: 1) for normative statements that are machine testable, at
least two interoperable implementations per feature, and 2) for normative
statements that are not machine testable, at least two demonstrations of
implementation per feature. A feature is defined as one or more functionally
related normative statements in the specification.
    </p>

    <p>
At present, there exist
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/#did-methods">82
experimental DID Method specifications</a>, 32 experimental DID Method driver
implementations, and a Candidate Recommendation <a
href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/">test suite</a> that determines
whether or not a given implementation is conformant with this specification.
Readers are advised to heed the  <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues">DID Core issues</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues"> DID Core Test Suite

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
As individuals and organizations, many of us use globally unique identifiers in
a wide variety of contexts. They serve as communications addresses (telephone
numbers, email addresses, usernames on social media), ID numbers (for passports,
drivers licenses, tax IDs, health insurance), and product identifiers (serial
numbers, barcodes, RFIDs). URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) are used for
resources on the Web and each web page you view in a browser has a globally
unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
    </p>
    <p>
The vast majority of these globally unique identifiers are not under our
control. They are issued by external authorities that decide who or what they
identify and when they can be revoked. They are useful only in certain contexts
and recognized only by certain bodies not of our choosing. They might
disappear or cease to be valid with the failure of an organization. They might
unnecessarily reveal personal information. In many cases, they can be
fraudulently replicated and asserted by a malicious third-party, which is
more commonly known as "identity theft".
    </p>
    <p>
The Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) defined in this specification are a new
type of globally unique identifier. They are designed to enable individuals and
organizations to generate their own identifiers using systems they trust. These
new identifiers enable entities to prove control over them by authenticating
using cryptographic proofs such as digital signatures.
    </p>
    <p>
Since the generation and assertion of Decentralized Identifiers is
entity-controlled, each entity can have as many DIDs as necessary to maintain
their desired separation of identities, personas, and interactions. The use of
these identifiers can be scoped appropriately to different contexts. They
support interactions with other people, institutions, or systems that require
entities to identify themselves, or things they control, while providing control
over how much personal or private data should be revealed, all without depending
on a central authority to guarantee the continued existence of the identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
This specification does not presuppose any particular technology or cryptography
to underpin the generation, persistence, resolution, or interpretation of DIDs.
For example, implementers can create Decentralized Identifiers based on
identifiers registered in federated or centralized identity management systems.
Indeed, almost all types of identifier systems can add support for DIDs. This
creates an interoperability bridge between the worlds of centralized, federated,
and decentralized identifiers. This also enables implementers to design specific
types of DIDs to work with the computing infrastructure they trust, such as
distributed ledgers, decentralized file systems, distributed databases, and
peer-to-peer networks.
    </p>
    <p>
This specification is for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
Anyone that wants to understand the core architectural principles that
are the foundation for Decentralized Identifiers;
      </li>

      <li>
Software developers that want to produce and consume Decentralized Identifiers
and their associated data formats;
      </li>
      <li>
Systems integrators that want to understand how to use Decentralized
Identifiers in their software and hardware systems;
      </li>
      <li>
Specification authors that want to create new DID infrastructures, known as DID
methods, that conform to the ecosystem described by this document.

      <h2>A Simple Example</h2>

      <p>
A <a>DID</a> is a simple text string consisting of three parts: 1) the
<code>did</code> URI scheme identifier, 2) the identifier for the <a>DID
method</a>, and 3) the DID method-specific identifier.
      </p>

        <dt>
DIDs and DID URLs
        </dt>
        <dd>
A Decentralized Identifier, or <a>DID</a>, is a <a>URI</a> composed of three
parts: the scheme <code>did:</code>, a method identifier, and a unique,
method-specific identifier specified by the <a>DID method</a>. <a>DIDs</a> are
resolvable to <a>DID documents</a>. A <a>DID URL</a> extends the syntax of a
basic <a>DID</a> to incorporate other standard <a>URI</a> components such as
path, query, and fragment in order to locate a particular
<a>resource</a>&mdash;for example, a cryptographic public key inside a <a>DID
document</a>, or a <a>resource</a> external to the <a>DID document</a>.
These concepts are elaborated upon in <a href="#did-syntax"></a> and <a
href="#did-url-syntax"></a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID subjects
        </dt>
        <dd>
The subject of a <a>DID</a> is, by definition, the entity identified by the
<a>DID</a>. The <a>DID subject</a> might also be the <a>DID controller</a>.
Anything can be the subject of a <a>DID</a>: person, group, organization,
thing, or concept. This is further defined in <a href="#did-subject"></a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID controllers
        </dt>
        <dd>
The <a>controller</a> of a <a>DID</a> is the entity (person, organization, or
autonomous software) that has the capability&mdash;as defined by a <a>DID
method</a>&mdash;to make changes to a <a>DID document</a>. This capability is
typically asserted by the control of a set of cryptographic keys used by
software acting on behalf of the controller, though it might also be asserted
via other mechanisms. Note that a <a>DID</a> might have more than one
controller, and the <a>DID subject</a> can be the <a>DID controller</a>, or one
of them. This concept is documented in <a href="#did-controller"></a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
Verifiable data registries
        </dt>
        <dd>
In order to be resolvable to <a>DID documents</a>, <a>DIDs</a> are typically
recorded on an underlying system or network of some kind. Regardless of the
specific technology used, any such system that supports recording <a>DIDs</a>
and returning data necessary to produce <a>DID documents</a> is called a
<a>verifiable data registry</a>. Examples include <a>distributed ledgers</a>,
decentralized file systems, databases of any kind, peer-to-peer networks, and
other forms of trusted data storage. This concept is further elaborated upon in
<a href="#methods"></a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID documents
        </dt>
        <dd>
<a>DID documents</a> contain information associated with a <a>DID</a>. They
typically express <a>verification methods</a>, such as cryptographic public
keys, and <a>services</a> relevant to interactions with the <a>DID subject</a>.
The generic properties supported in a <a>DID document</a> are specified in <a
href="#core-properties"></a>.  A <a>DID document</a> can be serialized to a byte
stream (see <a href="#representations"></a>). The properties present in
a <a>DID document</a> can be updated according to the applicable operations
outlined in <a href="#methods"></a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID methods
        </dt>

This document contains examples that contain JSON, CBOR, and JSON-LD content.
Some of these examples contain characters that are invalid, such as inline
comments (<code>//</code>) and the use of ellipsis (<code>...</code>) to denote

remove this content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON, CBOR,

Some examples contain terms, both property names and values, that are not

Interoperability of implementations for <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> is
tested by evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse <a>DIDs</a>

browser is not required to implement all known <a>URI</a> schemes, conformant
software that works with <a>DIDs</a> is not required to implement all known

The generic <a>DID scheme</a> is a <a>URI</a> scheme conformant with
[[!RFC3986]]. The ABNF definition can be found below, which uses the syntax in
[[!RFC5234]] and the corresponding definitions for <code>ALPHA</code> and

This ABNF does not currently permit an empty <code>method-specific-id</code>
string. Some DID methods have expressed an interest in providing resolution of
a DID with an empty <code>method-specific-id</code> string, for example to
enable discovery of a DID document describing a <a>verifiable data registry</a>
by resolving the DID method name alone. The Working Group is requesting feedback
during the Candidate Recommendation stage on whether or not an empty
<code>method-specific-id</code> string is of interest to implementers. This
feature may change as a result of that feedback. See also <a

        <h2>DID Parameters</h2>

        <p>
The <a>DID URL</a> syntax supports a simple format for parameters based on the
<code>query</code> component described in <a href="#query"></a>. Adding a DID
parameter to a <a>DID URL</a> means that the parameter becomes part of the
identifier for a <a>resource</a>.

        </pre>

        <p>
Some DID parameters are completely independent of of any specific <a>DID
method</a> and function the same way for all <a>DIDs</a>. Other DID parameters
are not supported by all <a>DID methods</a>. Where optional parameters are
supported, they are expected to operate uniformly across the <a>DID methods</a>
that do support them. The following table provides common DID parameters that
function the same way across all <a>DID methods</a>.  Support for all

        <p>
Implementers as well as <a>DID method</a> specification authors might use
additional DID parameters that are not listed here. For maximum
interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that DID parameters use the DID
Specification Registries mechanism [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]], to avoid collision
with other uses of the same DID parameter with different semantics.
        </p>

        <p>
DID parameters might be used if there is a clear use case where the parameter
needs to be part of a <a>URL</a> that references a <a>resource</a> with more
precision than using the <a>DID</a> alone. It is expected that DID parameters
are <em>not</em> used if the same functionality can be expressed by passing
input metadata to a <a>DID resolver</a>. Additional considerations for
processing these parameters are discussed in [[?DID-RESOLUTION]].
        </p>

        <p class="note" title="DID parameters and DID resolution">
The <a>DID resolution</a> and the <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> functions can
be influenced by passing input metadata to a <a>DID resolver</a> that are
not part of the <a>DID URL</a> (see <a
href="#did-resolution-options"></a>). This is comparable to
HTTP, where certain parameters could either be included in an HTTP URL, or
alternatively passed as HTTP headers during the dereferencing process. The
important distinction is that DID parameters that are part of the <a>DID
URL</a> should be used to specify <em>what <a>resource</a> is being
identified</em>, whereas input metadata that is not part of the <a>DID URL</a>
should be use to control <em>how that <a>resource</a> is resolved or
dereferenced</em>.

        <h2>Relative DID URLs</h2>

        <p>
A relative <a>DID URL</a> is any URL value in a <a>DID document</a> that does
not start with <code>did:&lt;method-name>:&lt;method-specific-id></code>. More
specifically, it is any URL value that does not start with the ABNF defined in
<a href="#did-syntax"></a>. The URL is expected to reference
a <a>resource</a> in the same <a>DID document</a>. Relative <a>DID URLs</a> MAY
contain relative path components, query parameters, and fragment identifiers.
        </p>

        <p>
When resolving a relative <a>DID URL</a> reference, the algorithm specified in
<a data-cite="RFC3986#section-5">RFC3986 Section 5: Reference Resolution</a>
MUST be used. The <strong>base URI</strong> value is the <a>DID</a> that is
associated with the <a>DID subject</a>, see <a href="#did-subject"></a>. The
<strong>scheme</strong> is <code>did</code>. The <strong>authority</strong> is a
combination of <code>&lt;method-name>:&lt;method-specific-id></code>, and the
<strong>path</strong>, <strong>query</strong>, and <strong>fragment</strong>
values are those defined in <a href="#path"></a>, <a href="#query"></a>, and <a
href="#fragment"></a>, respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
Relative <a>DID URLs</a> are often used to reference <a>verification methods</a>
and <a>services</a> in a <a>DID Document</a> without having to use absolute
URLs. <a>DID methods</a> where storage size is a consideration might use
relative URLs to reduce the storage size of <a>DID documents</a>.

      <h2>Extensibility</h2>
      <p>
The data model supports two types of extensibility.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
For maximum interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that extensions use the
W3C DID Specification Registries mechanism [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. The use of
this mechanism for new properties or other extensions is the only specified
mechanism that ensures that two different <a>representations</a> will be able to
work together.
        </li>
      <li>
<a>Representations</a> MAY define other extensibility mechanisms, including ones
that do not require the use of the DID Specification Registries. Such extension
mechanisms SHOULD support lossless conversion into any other conformant
<a>representation</a>. Extension mechanisms for a <a>representation</a> SHOULD
define a mapping of all properties and <a>representation</a> syntax into the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> and its type system.
      </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note" title="Unregistered extensions are less reliable">
It is always possible for two specific implementations to agree out-of-band to
use a mutually understood extension or <a>representation</a> that is not
recorded in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]];
interoperability between such implementations and the larger ecosystem will be
less reliable.

    <h1>Core Properties</h1>

    <p>
A <a>DID</a> is associated with a <a>DID document</a>.
<a>DID documents</a> are expressed using the
<a href="#data-model">data model</a> and can be serialized into a
<a href="#representations">representation</a>.
The following sections define the properties in a <a>DID document</a>,
including whether these properties are required or optional. These properties
describe relationships between the <a>DID subject</a> and the value of the
property.
    </p>
    <p>
The following tables contain informative references for the core properties
defined by this specification, with expected values, and whether or not they are
required. The property names in the tables are linked to the normative
definitions and more detailed descriptions of each property.
    </p>
    <p class="note" title="Property names used in maps of different types">
The property names <code>id</code>, <code>type</code>, and

      <h2>Identifiers</h2>

      <p>

This section describes the mechanisms by which <a>DID documents</a>
include identifiers for <a>DID subjects</a> and <a>DID controllers</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>DID Subject</h3>
        <p>
The <a>DID</a> for a particular <a>DID subject</a> is expressed using the
<code><a>id</a></code> property in the <a>DID document</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>id</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The value of <code>id</code> MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> that conforms to the rules in <a
href="#did-syntax"></a> and MUST exist in the root <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> of the <a href="#data-model">data
model</a> for the <a>DID document</a>.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <pre class="example nohighlight">
{
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghijk"
}
        </pre>

        <p>
The <code>id</code> property only denotes the <a>DID</a> of the
<a>DID subject</a> when it is present in the <em>topmost</em>
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> of the <a>DID document</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="note" title="Intermediate representations">
<a>DID method</a> specifications can create intermediate representations of a
<a>DID document</a> that do not contain the <code><a>id</a></code> property,
such as when a <a>DID resolver</a> is performing <a>DID resolution</a>.
However, the fully resolved <a>DID document</a> always contains a valid
<code><a>id</a></code> property.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>DID Controller</h3>

        <p>
A <a>DID controller</a> is an entity that is authorized to make changes to a
<a>DID document</a>. The process of authorizing a <a>DID controller</a> is
defined by the <a>DID method</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>controller</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>controller</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> or a <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">strings</a> that conform to the rules in <a
href="#did-syntax"></a>. The corresponding <a>DID document</a>(s) SHOULD
contain <a>verification relationships</a> that explicitly permit the use of
certain <a>verification methods</a> for specific purposes.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
When a <code><a>controller</a></code> property is present in a <a>DID
document</a>, its value expresses one or more <a>DIDs</a>. Any <a>verification
methods</a> contained in the <a>DID documents</a> for those <a>DIDs</a> SHOULD
be accepted as authoritative, such that proofs that satisfy those
<a>verification methods</a> are to be considered equivalent to proofs provided
by the <a>DID subject</a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="DID document with a controller property">

  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "controller": "did:example:bcehfew7h32f32h7af3",
}
        </pre>

        <p class="note" title="Authorization vs authentication">
Note that authorization provided by the value of <code>controller</code> is
separate from authentication as described in <a href="#authentication"></a>.
This is particularly important for key recovery in the case of cryptographic key
loss, where the <a>DID subject</a> no longer has access to their keys, or key
compromise, where the <a>DID controller</a>'s trusted third parties need to
override malicious activity by an attacker. See <a
href="#security-considerations"></a> for information related to threat models
and attack vectors.

        <h3>Also Known As</h3>

        <p class="issue atrisk" title="Implementation of alsoKnownAs">
The DID Working Group is seeking implementer feedback regarding
the alsoKnownAs feature. If there is not enough
implementer interest in implementing this feature, it will be removed
from this specification and placed into the DID Specification Registries
[[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]] as an extension.
        </p>

        <p>
A <a>DID subject</a> can have multiple identifiers for different purposes, or
at different times. The assertion that two or more <a>DIDs</a> (or other types
of <a>URI</a>) identify the same <a>DID subject</a> can be made using the
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> property.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>alsoKnownAs</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>alsoKnownAs</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> where each item in the
set is a <a>URI</a> conforming to [[RFC3986]].
          </dd>
          <dd>
This relationship is a statement that the subject of this identifier is
also identified by one or more other identifiers.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <div class="note" title="Equivalence and alsoKnownAs">
          <p>
Applications might choose to consider two identifiers related by
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> to be equivalent <em>if</em> the
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> relationship is reciprocated in the reverse
direction. It is best practice <em>not</em> to consider them equivalent in the
absence of this inverse relationship. In other words, the presence of an
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> assertion does not prove that this assertion
is true. Therefore, it is strongly advised that a requesting party obtain
independent verification of an <code>alsoKnownAs</code> assertion.
          </p>
          <p>
Given that the <a>DID subject</a> might use different identifiers for different
purposes, an expectation of strong equivalence between the two identifiers, or
merging the information of the two corresponding <a>DID documents</a>, is not
necessarily appropriate, <em>even with</em> a reciprocal relationship.

      <h2>Verification Methods</h2>
      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> can express <a>verification methods</a>, such as
cryptographic public keys, which can be used to <a>authenticate</a> or authorize
interactions with the <a>DID subject</a> or associated parties. For example, a
cryptographic public key can be used as a <a>verification method</a> with
respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it verifies that the signer
could use the associated cryptographic private key. <a>Verification methods</a>
might take many parameters. An example of this is a set of five cryptographic
keys from which any three are required to contribute to a cryptographic
threshold signature.

The <code>verificationMethod</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value
MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of <a>verification
methods</a>, where each <a>verification method</a> is expressed using a <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>. The <a>verification method</a> <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST include the <code>id</code>,
<code>type</code>, <code>controller</code>, and specific verification material
properties that are determined by the value of <code>type</code> and are defined
in <a href="#verification-material"></a>. A <a>verification method</a> MAY
include additional properties. <a>Verification methods</a> SHOULD be registered
in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

        title="Verification method controller(s) and DID controller(s)">
The semantics of the <code>controller</code> property are the same when the
subject of the relationship is the <a>DID document</a> as when the subject of
the relationship is a <a>verification method</a>, such as a cryptographic public
key. Since a key can't control itself, and the key controller cannot be inferred
from the <a>DID document</a>, it is necessary to explicitly express the identity
of the controller of the key. The difference is that the value of
<code>controller</code> for a <a>verification method</a> is <em>not</em>
necessarily a <a>DID controller</a>. <a>DID controllers</a> are expressed
using the <code><a>controller</a></code> property at the highest level of the
<a>DID document</a> (the topmost <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> in the
<a href="#data-model">data model</a>); see <a href="#did-controller"></a>.

        <h3>Verification Material</h3>

        <p>
Verification material is any information that is used by a process
that applies a <a>verification method</a>. The <code>type</code>
of a <a>verification method</a> is expected to be used to determine
its compatibility with such processes. Examples
of verification material properties are <code><a>publicKeyJwk</a></code> or
<code><a>publicKeyBase58</a></code>. A verification suite definition is
responsible for specifying the <a>verification method</a> <code>type</code> and
its associated verification material. For example, see <a
href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">JSON Web Signature 2020</a> and <a
href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-ed25519-2018/">Ed25519 Signature 2018</a>.
For all registered <a>verification method</a> types and associated verification
material available for <a>DIDs</a>, please see the DID Specification Registries
[[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
        </p>

        <p>
To increase the likelihood of interoperable implementations, this specification
limits the number of formats for expressing verification material in a <a>DID
document</a>. The fewer formats that implementers have to
implement, the more likely it will be that they will support all of them. This
approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between ease of implementation
and supporting formats that have historically had broad deployment.
Two supported verification material properties are listed below:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>publicKeyBase58</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
The <code>publicKeyBase58</code> property is OPTIONAL. This feature is
non-normative. If present, the value MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> representation of a [[?BASE58]] encoded
public key.
            </p>
            <p class="issue atrisk"
               title="publicKeyBase58 and publicKeyMultibase">
The DID Working Group is seeking implementer feedback on the preference of the
ecosystem with respect to using <code>publicKeyBase58</code> [[?BASE58]]  or
<code>publicKeyMultibase</code> [[?MULTIBASE]]. The latter can be used for
encoding more base-representation formats and provides a more future proof path.
Depending on implementer feedback, one or both options might be included in the
final specification, or migrated into the DID Specification Registries as an
extension.
             </p>
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>publicKeyJwk</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
The <code>publicKeyJwk</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> representing a JSON Web Key that
conforms to [[RFC7517]]. The <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST NOT
contain "d", or any other members of the private information class as described
in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-8.1.1">Registration
Template</a>. It is RECOMMENDED that verification methods that use JWKs
[[RFC7517]] to represent their public keys use the value of <code>kid</code> as
their <a href="#fragment">fragment identifier</a>. It is RECOMMENDED that JWK
<code>kid</code> values are set to the public key fingerprint [[RFC7638]]. See
the first key in <a href="#example-various-verification-method-types"></a> for
an example of a public key with a compound key identifier.
            </p>
          </dd>
      </dl>

        <p>
A <a>verification method</a> MUST NOT contain multiple verification material
properties for the same material. For example, expressing key material in a
<a>verification method</a> using both <code>publicKeyJwk</code> and
<code>publicKeyBase58</code> at the same time is prohibited.
        </p>

        <p>
An example of a <a>DID document</a> containing <a>verification methods</a> using
both properties above is shown below.

        <h3>Referring to Verification Methods</h3>
        <p>
<a>Verification methods</a> can be embedded in or referenced from properties
associated with various <a>verification relationships</a> as described in <a
href="#verification-relationships"></a>. Referencing <a>verification methods</a>
allows them to be used by more than one <a>verification relationship</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
If the value of a <a>verification method</a> property is a <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>, the <a>verification method</a> has been
embedded and its properties can be accessed directly. However, if the value is a
URL <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>, the <a>verification method</a> has
been included by reference and its properties will need to be retrieved from
elsewhere in the <a>DID document</a> or from another <a>DID document</a>. This
is done by dereferencing the URL and searching the resulting <a>resource</a> for a
<a>verification method</a> <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> with an
<code>id</code> property whose value matches the URL.

      <h2>Verification Relationships</h2>

      <p>
A <a>verification relationship</a> expresses the relationship between the <a>DID
subject</a> and a <a>verification method</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
Different <a>verification relationships</a> enable the associated
<a>verification methods</a> to be used for different purposes. It is up to a
<em>verifier</em> to ascertain the validity of a verification attempt by
checking that the <a>verification method</a> used is contained in the
appropriate <a>verification relationship</a> property of the
<a>DID Document</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
The <a>verification relationship</a> between the <a>DID subject</a> and the
<a>verification method</a> is explicit in the <a>DID document</a>.
<a>Verification methods</a> that are not associated with a particular
<a>verification relationship</a> cannot be used for that <a>verification
relationship</a>. For example, a <a>verification method</a> in the value of
the <code><a>authentication</a></code> property cannot be used to engage in
key agreement protocols with the <a>DID subject</a>&mdash;the value of the
<code><a>keyAgreement</a></code> property needs to be used for that.
      </p>
      <p>
The <a>DID document</a> does not express revoked keys using a <a>verification
relationship</a>. If a referenced verification method is not in the latest
<a>DID Document</a> used to dereference it, then that verification method is
considered invalid or revoked. Each <a>DID method</a> specification is expected
to detail how revocation is performed and tracked.
      </p>
      <p>
The following sections define several useful <a>verification relationships</a>.
A <a>DID document</a> MAY include any of these, or other properties, to
express a specific <a>verification relationship</a>. In order to maximize global
interoperability, any such properties used SHOULD be registered in the DID
Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Authentication</h2>

        <p>
The <code>authentication</code> <a>verification relationship</a> is used to
specify how the <a>DID subject</a> is expected to be <a>authenticated</a>, for
purposes such as logging into a website or engaging in any sort of
challenge-response protocol.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>authentication</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>authentication</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated
value MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of one or more
<a>verification methods</a>. Each <a>verification method</a> MAY be embedded or
referenced.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Authentication property

    }
  ],
  <span class="comment">...</span>
}
        </pre>

        <p>
If authentication is established, it is up to the <a>DID method</a> or other
application to decide what to do with that information. A particular <a>DID
method</a> could decide that authenticating as a <a>DID controller</a> is
sufficient to, for example, update or delete the <a>DID document</a>. Another
<a>DID method</a> could require different keys, or a different <a>verification
method</a> entirely, to be presented in order to update or delete the <a>DID
document</a> than that used to <a>authenticate</a>. In other words, what is done
<em>after</em> the authentication check is out of scope for the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a>; <a>DID methods</a> and applications are
expected to define this themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
This is useful to any <em>authentication verifier</em> that needs to check to
see if an entity that is attempting to <a>authenticate</a> is, in fact,
presenting a valid proof of authentication. When a <em>verifier</em> receives
some data (in some protocol-specific format) that contains a proof that was made
for the purpose of "authentication", and that says that an entity is identified
by the <a>DID</a>, then that <em>verifier</em> checks to ensure that the proof
can be verified using a <a>verification method</a> (e.g., public key) listed
under <code><a>authentication</a></code> in the <a>DID Document</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
Note that the <a>verification method</a> indicated by the
<code><a>authentication</a></code> property of a <a>DID document</a> can only be
used to <a>authenticate</a> the <a>DID subject</a>. To <a>authenticate</a> a
different <a>DID controller</a>, the entity associated with the value of
<code>controller</code>, as defined in <a href="#did-controller"></a>, needs to
<a>authenticate</a> with its <em>own</em> <a>DID document</a> and associated
<code><a>authentication</a></code> <a>verification relationship</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Assertion</h2>

        <p>
The <code>assertionMethod</code> <a>verification relationship</a> is used to
specify how the <a>DID subject</a> is expected to express claims, such as for
the purposes of issuing a Verifiable Credential [[?VC-DATA-MODEL]].
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>assertionMethod</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>assertionMethod</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the
associated value MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of
one or more <a>verification methods</a>. Each <a>verification method</a> MAY be
embedded or referenced.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
This property is useful, for example, during the processing of a <a>verifiable
credential</a> by a verifier. During verification, a verifier checks to see if a
<a>verifiable credential</a> contains a proof created by the <a>DID subject</a>
by checking that the <a>verification method</a> used to assert the proof is
associated with the <code><a>assertionMethod</a></code> property in the
corresponding <a>DID document</a>.

      <section>
        <h2>Key Agreement</h2>

        <p>
The <code>keyAgreement</code> <a>verification relationship</a> is used to
specify how an entity can generate encryption material in order to transmit
confidential information intended for the <a>DID subject</a>, such as for
the purposes of establishing a secure communication channel with the recipient.
        </p>

        <dl>

The <code>keyAgreement</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated

          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when encrypting a message intended

cryptographic public key information in the <a>verification method</a> to wrap a
decryption key for the recipient.

      <section>
        <h2>Capability Invocation</h2>

        <p>
The <code>capabilityInvocation</code> <a>verification relationship</a> is used
to specify a <a>verification method</a> that might be used by the <a>DID
subject</a> to invoke a cryptographic capability, such as the authorization to
update the <a>DID Document</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>capabilityInvocation</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>capabilityInvocation</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the
associated value MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of
one or more <a>verification methods</a>. Each <a>verification method</a> MAY be
embedded or referenced.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when a <a>DID subject</a> needs to
access a protected HTTP API that requires authorization in order to use it. In
order to authorize when using the HTTP API, the <a>DID subject</a>
uses a capability that is associated with a particular URL that is
exposed via the HTTP API. The invocation of the capability could be
expressed in a number of ways, e.g., as a digitally signed
message that is placed into the HTTP Headers.
        </p>
        <p>
The server providing the HTTP API is the <em>verifier</em> of the capability and
it would need to verify that the <a>verification method</a> referred to by the
invoked capability exists in the <code><a>capabilityInvocation</a></code>
property of the <a>DID document</a>. The verifier would also check to make sure
that the action being performed is valid and the capability is appropriate for
the resource being accessed. If the verification is successful, the server has
cryptographically determined that the invoker is authorized to access the
protected resource.

        <h2>Capability Delegation</h2>

        <p>
The <code>capabilityDelegation</code> <a>verification relationship</a> is used
to specify a mechanism that might be used by the <a>DID subject</a> to delegate
a cryptographic capability to another party, such as delegating the authority
to access a specific HTTP API to a subordinate.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>capabilityDelegation</dfn></dt>

The <code>capabilityDelegation</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the

one or more <a>verification methods</a>. Each <a>verification method</a> MAY be
embedded or referenced.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when a <a>DID controller</a>
chooses to delegate their capability to access a protected HTTP API to a party
other than themselves. In order to delegate the capability, the <a>DID
subject</a> would use a <a>verification method</a> associated with the
<code>capabilityDelegation</code> <a>verification relationship</a> to
cryptographically sign the capability over to another <a>DID subject</a>. The
delegate would then use the capability in a manner that is similar to the
example described in <a href="#capability-invocation"></a>.

      <h2>Services</h2>

      <p>
<a>Services</a> are used in <a>DID documents</a> to express ways of
communicating with the <a>DID subject</a> or associated entities. A
<a>service</a> can be any type of service the <a>DID subject</a> wants to
advertise, including <a>decentralized identity management</a> services for
further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
Due to privacy concerns, revealing public information through <a>services</a>,
such as social media accounts, personal websites, and email addresses, is
discouraged. Further exploration of privacy concerns can be found in <a
href="#keep-personal-data-private"></a> and <a href="#service-privacy"></a>. The
information associated with <a>services</a> is often service specific. For
example, the information associated with an encrypted messaging service can
express how to initiate the encrypted link before messaging begins.
      </p>

      <p>
<a>Services</a> are expressed using the <code><a>service</a></code> property,

The <code>service</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated value
MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of <a>services</a>,
where each service is described by a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>.
Each <a>service</a> <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST contain
<code><a>id</a></code>, <code>type</code>, and
<code><a>serviceEndpoint</a></code> properties. Each service extension MAY
include additional properties and MAY further restrict the properties associated
with the extension.

            <dd>
The value of the <code>id</code> property MUST be a <a>URI</a> conforming to
[[RFC3986]]. A <a>conforming producer</a> MUST NOT produce
multiple <code>service</code> entries with the same <code>id</code>.
A <a>conforming consumer</a> MUST produce an error if it detects
multiple <code>service</code> entries with the same <code>id</code>.

    <h1>Representations</h1>

    <p>
A concrete serialization of a <a>DID document</a> in this specification is
called a <a>representation</a>. A <a>representation</a> is created by
serializing the <a href="#data-model">data model</a> through a process called
<dfn>production</dfn>. A <a>representation</a> is transformed into the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> through a process called
<dfn>consumption</dfn>. The <em>production</em> and <em>consumption</em>
processes enable the conversion of information from one <a>representation</a> to
another. This specification defines <a>representations</a> for JSON, JSON-LD,
and CBOR, and developers can use any other <a>representation</a>, such as XML or
YAML, that is capable of expressing the <a href="#data-model">data model</a>.
The following sections define the general rules for <a>production</a> and
<a>consumption</a>, as well as the JSON, JSON-LD, and CBOR
<a>representations</a>.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Production and Consumption</h2>

      <p>
In addition to the <a>representations</a> defined in this specification,
implementers can use other <a>representations</a>, providing each such
<a>representation</a> is properly specified (including rules for
interoperable handling of properties not listed in the DID Specification
Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]). See <a href="#extensibility"></a>
for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
The requirements for all <a>representations</a> are as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>representation</a> MUST define deterministic production and consumption
rules for all data types specified in <a href="#data-model"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>representation</a> MUST be uniquely associated with an IANA-registered
Media Type.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>representation</a> MUST define fragment processing rules for its Media
Type that are conformant with the fragment processing rules defined in
<a href="#fragment"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>representation</a> SHOULD use the lexical representation of <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> data types. For example, JSON and JSON-LD use
the XML Schema <code>dateTime</code> lexical serialization to represent
<a>datetimes</a>. A <a>representation</a> MAY choose to serialize the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> data types using a different lexical
serializations as long as the <a>consumption</a> process back into the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> is lossless. For example, some CBOR-based
<a>representations</a> express <a>datetime</a> values using integers to
represent the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>representation</a> MAY define representation-specific entries that are
stored in a representation-specific entries <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>
for use during the <a>production</a> and <a>consumption</a> process. These
entries are used when consuming or producing to aid in ensuring lossless
conversion.
        </li>
        <li>
In order to maximize interoperability, <a>representation</a> specification
authors SHOULD register their <a>representation</a> in the DID Specification
Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
The requirements for all <a>conforming producers</a> are as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>conforming producer</a> MUST take a <a>DID document</a> <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> and a representation-specific entries <a
data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a> as input into the <a>production</a> process.
The <a>conforming producer</a> MAY accept additional options as input
into the <a>production</a> process.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>conforming producer</a> MUST serialize all entries in the <a>DID
document</a> <a href="#data-model">data model</a>, and the
representation-specific entries <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>, that do not
have explicit processing rules for the <a>representation</a> being produced
using only the <a>representation</a>'s data type processing rules and
return the serialization after the <a>production</a> process completes.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>conforming producer</a> MUST return the Media Type <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> associated with the <a>representation</a>
after the <a>production</a> process completes.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
The requirements for all <a>conforming consumers</a> are as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>conforming consumer</a> MUST take a <a>representation</a> and
Media Type <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> as input into
the <a>consumption</a> process. A <a>conforming consumer</a> MAY accept
additional options as input into the <a>consumption</a> process.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>conforming consumer</a> MUST determine the <a>representation</a> of a
<a>DID document</a> using the Media Type input <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>conforming consumer</a> MUST detect any representation-specific
entry across all known <a>representations</a> and place the entry into a
representation-specific entries <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a> which is
returned after the <a>consumption</a> process completes. A list of
all known representation-specific entries is available in the
DID Specification Registries [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>conforming consumer</a> MUST add all non-representation-specific entries
that do not have explicit processing rules for the <a>representation</a> being
consumed to the <a>DID document</a> <a href="#data-model">data model</a> using
only the <a>representation</a>'s data type processing rules and return the
<a>DID document</a> data model after the <a>consumption</a> process completes.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="note" title="Conversion between representations">
An implementation is expected to convert between <a>representations</a> by using the
<em>consumption</em> rules on the source representation resulting in the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> and then using the <em>production</em> rules
to serialize <a href="#data-model">data model</a> to the target representation,
or any other mechanism that results in the same target representation.

      <h2>JSON-LD</h2>

      <p>
JSON-LD [[JSON-LD11]] is a JSON-based format used to serialize <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data">Linked Data</a>. This
section defines the <a>production</a> and <a>consumption</a> rules for the
JSON-LD <a>representation</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
The JSON-LD <a>representation</a> defines the following representation-specific
entries:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>@context</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#the-context">JSON-LD Context</a>
is either a <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> or a <a

        <h3>Production</h3>

        <p>
The <a>DID document</a>, DID document data structures, and
representation-specific entries <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a> MUST
be serialized to the JSON-LD <a>representation</a> according to the JSON
<a>representation</a> <a>production</a> rules as defined in <a
href="#json"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
In addition to using the JSON <a>representation</a> <a>production</a> rules,
JSON-LD production MUST include the representation-specific
<a><code>@context</code></a> entry. The serialized value of
<code>@context</code> MUST be the <a data-cite="RFC8259#section-7">JSON
String</a> <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1</code>, or a <a
data-cite="RFC8259#section-5">JSON Array</a> where the first item is the <a
data-cite="RFC8259#section-7">JSON String</a>
<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1</code> and the subsequent items are
serialized according to the JSON <a>representation</a> <a>production</a>
rules.

    <p class="issue atrisk" title="Concerns regarding testability of DID Resolution and Dereferencing">
The Working Group is unsure if there will be enough implementation experience
for the DID Resolution section. We are seeking feedback from the implementation
community as to whether they prefer to do all of this work now, or if they would
prefer that this section is, or parts of the section are, rewritten to be
non-normative, or published as a NOTE and taken up in a future W3C DID
Resolution Working Group. If there is support for rewriting a subset of the DID
Resolution section, or publishing any part of it as a NOTE during the W3C
Candidate Recommendation process, this section will be modified and/or published
as a NOTE appropriately before the DID Core specification proceeds to the W3C
Proposed Recommendation stage. See also <a

This section defines the inputs and outputs of <a>DID resolution</a> and <a>DID

specification, but some considerations for implementers are discussed in
[[?DID-RESOLUTION]].
    </p>

    <p>
All conformant <a>DID resolvers</a> MUST implement the <a>DID resolution</a>

      <h2>DID Resolution</h2>
      <p>
The <a>DID resolution</a> functions resolve a <a>DID</a> into a <a>DID
document</a> by using the "Read" operation of the applicable <a>DID method</a>
as described in <a href="#method-operations"></a>. The details of how this
process is accomplished are outside the scope of this specification, but all
conforming <a>DID resolvers</a> implement the functions below, which have the
following abstract forms:
      </p>

      <pre title="Abstract functions for DID Resolution">
resolve(did, resolutionOptions) →
   « didResolutionMetadata, didDocument, didDocumentMetadata »

resolveRepresentation(did, resolutionOptions) →

      </pre>

      <p>
The <code>resolve</code> function returns the <a>DID document</a> in its
abstract form (a <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>). The
<code>resolveRepresentation</code> function returns a byte stream of the <a>DID
Document</a> formatted in the corresponding representation. The input variables
of the <code>resolve</code> and <code>resolveRepresentation</code> functions are
as follows:

      <p>
These functions each return multiple values, and no limitations
are placed on how these values are returned together.
The return values of <code>resolve</code> are
<a>didResolutionMetadata</a>, <a>didDocument</a>, and
<a>didDocumentMetadata</a>. The return values of
<code>resolveRepresentation</code> are
<a>didResolutionMetadata</a>, <a>didDocumentStream</a>, and

error in the resolution process, this MUST NOT be empty.
This metadata is defined by <a href="#did-resolution-metadata"></a>. If
<code>resolveRepresentation</code> was called, this structure MUST contain a

is capable of being transformed into a <a>conforming DID Document</a>

<dfn>didDocumentStream</dfn>

If the resolution is successful, and if the <code>resolveRepresentation</code>

document</a> in one of the conformant
<a href="#representations">representations</a>. The byte stream might then be
parsed by the caller of the <code>resolveRepresentation</code> function into a
<a href="#data-model">data model</a>, which can in turn be validated and

A <a>DID Method</a> can define different forms of a <a>DID</a> that are
logically equivalent. An example is when a <a>DID</a> takes one form prior to
registration in a <a>verifiable data registry</a> and another form after such
registration. In this case, the <a>DID Method</a> specification might need to
express one or more <a>DIDs</a> that are logically equivalent to the resolved
<a>DID</a> as a property of the <a>DID document</a>. This is the purpose of the
<code><a>equivalentId</a></code>  property.
            </p>
            <p>
The value of <code>equivalentId</code> MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> where each item is a
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> that conforms to the rules in Section <a
href="#did-syntax"></a>. The relationship is a statement that each
<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> value is logically equivalent to the
<code>id</code> property value and thus identifies the same <a>DID subject</a>.
Each <code><a>equivalentId</a></code> DID value MUST be produced by, and a form
of, the same <a>DID Method</a> as the <code>id</code> property value. (e.g.,
<code>did:example:abc</code> == <code>did:example:ABC</code>)
            </p>
            <p>
A conforming <a>DID Method</a> specification MUST guarantee that each
<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> value is logically equivalent to the
<code>id</code> property value.
            </p>
            <p>
A requesting party is expected to retain the values from the <code>id</code> and
<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> properties to ensure any subsequent
interactions with any of the values they contain are correctly handled as
logically equivalent (e.g., retain all variants in a database so an interaction
with any one maps to the same underlying account).
            </p>
            <p class="note" title="Stronger equivalence">
<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> is a much stronger form of equivalence than
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> because the equivalence MUST be guaranteed by
the governing <a>DID method</a>. <code><a>equivalentId</a></code> represents a
full graph merge because the same <a>DID document</a> describes both the
<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> <a>DID</a> and the <code>id</code> property
<a>DID</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
If a requesting party does not retain the values from the <code>id</code> and
<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> properties and ensure any subsequent
interactions with any of the values they contain are correctly handled as
logically equivalent, there might be negative or unexpected issues that
arise. Implementers are strongly advised to observe the

The <code><a>canonicalId</a></code> property is identical to the
<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> property except: a) it is associated with a
single value rather than a set, and b) the <a>DID</a> is defined to be
the canonical ID for the <a>DID subject</a> within the scope of the containing
<a>DID document</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
The value of <code><a>canonicalId</a></code> MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> that conforms to the rules in Section <a
href="#did-syntax"></a>. The relationship is a statement that the
<code><a>canonicalId</a></code> value is logically equivalent to the
<code>id</code> property value and that the <code><a>canonicalId</a></code>
value is defined by the <a>DID Method</a> to be the canonical ID for the <a>DID
subject</a> in the scope of the containing <a>DID document</a>. A
<code><a>canonicalId</a></code> value MUST be produced by, and a form of, the
same <a>DID Method</a> as the <code>id</code> property value. (e.g.,
<code>did:example:abc</code> == <code>did:example:ABC</code>). A conforming
<a>DID Method</a> specification MUST guarantee that the
<code><a>canonicalId</a></code> value is logically equivalent to the
<code>id</code> property value.
            </p>
            <p>
A requesting party is expected to use the <code><a>canonicalId</a></code> value
as its primary ID value for the <a>DID subject</a> and treat all other
equivalent values as secondary aliases (e.g., update corresponding primary
references in their systems to reflect the new canonical ID directive).
            </p>
            <p class="note" title="Canonical equivalence">
<code><a>canonicalId</a></code> is the same statement of equivalence as

<code><a>canonicalId</a></code> represents a full graph merge because the same

      <h2>Metadata Structure</h2>

      <p>
Input and output metadata is often involved during the <a>DID Resolution</a>,
<a>DID URL dereferencing</a>, and other DID-related processes. The structure
used to communicate this metadata MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>
of properties. Each property name MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>. Each property value MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>, <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>, <a
data-cite="INFRA#list">list</a>, <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a>,
<a data-cite="INFRA#boolean">boolean</a>, or
<a data-cite="INFRA#null">null</a>. The values within any complex data
structures such as maps and lists MUST be one of these data types as well.
All metadata property definitions registered in the DID Specification
Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]] MUST define the value type, including any
additional formats or restrictions to that value (for example, a string
formatted as a date or as a decimal integer). It is RECOMMENDED that property
definitions use strings for values. The entire metadata structure MUST be
serializable according to the <a
data-cite="INFRA#serialize-an-infra-value-to-json-bytes">JSON
serialization rules</a> in the [[INFRA]] specification. Implementations MAY
serialize the metadata structure to other data formats.
      </p>

      <p>
All implementations of functions that use metadata structures as either input or
output are able to fully represent all data types described here in a
deterministic fashion. As inputs and outputs using metadata structures are
defined in terms of data types and not their serialization, the method for
<a>representation</a> is internal to the implementation of the function and is
out of scope of this specification.
      </p>

      <p>
The following example demonstrates a JSON-encoded metadata structure that
might be used as <a href="#did-resolution-options">DID
resolution input metadata</a>.
      </p>

      <pre class="example"
        title="JSON-encoded DID resolution input metadata example">
{
  "accept": "application/did+ld+json"
}
      </pre>

      <p>
This example corresponds to a metadata structure of the following format:
      </p>

      <pre class="example"
        title="DID resolution input metadata example">
«[
  "accept" → "application/did+ld+json"
]»
      </pre>

      <p>
The next example demonstrates a JSON-encoded metadata structure that might be
used as <a href="#did-resolution-options">DID resolution
metadata</a> if a <a>DID</a> was not found.
      </p>

      <pre class="example"
        title="JSON-encoded DID resolution metadata example">
{
  "error": "notFound"
}
      </pre>

      <p>
This example corresponds to a metadata structure of the following format:

      <pre class="example"
        title="DID resolution metadata example">
«[
  "error" → "notFound"
]»
      </pre>

      <p>
The next example demonstrates a JSON-encoded metadata structure that might be
used as <a href="#did-document-metadata">DID document metadata</a>
to describe timestamps associated with the <a>DID document</a>.
      </p>

      <pre class="example" title="JSON-encoded DID document metadata example">
{
  "created": "2019-03-23T06:35:22Z",
  "updated": "2023-08-10T13:40:06Z"

    <h1>Methods</h1>

    <p>
A <a>DID method</a> defines how implementers can realize the features
described by this specification. <a>DID methods</a> are often associated with a
particular <a>verifiable data registry</a>. New <a>DID methods</a> are defined
in their own specifications to enable interoperability between different
implementations of the same <a>DID method</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
Conceptually, the relationship between this specification and a <a>DID
method</a> specification is similar to the relationship between the IETF generic
<a>URI</a> specification [[?RFC3986]] and a specific <a>URI</a> scheme
[[?IANA-URI-SCHEMES]], such as the <code>http</code> scheme [[?RFC7230]].  In
addition to defining a specific <a>DID scheme</a>, a <a>DID method</a>
specification also defines the mechanisms for creating, resolving, updating, and
deactivating <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> using a specific type of
<a>verifiable data registry</a>. It also documents all implementation
considerations related to <a>DIDs</a> as well as Security and Privacy
Considerations.
    </p>

    <p>
This section specifies the requirements for authoring <a>DID method</a>
specifications.
    </p>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2>Method Syntax</h2>

      <p>
The requirements for all <a>DID method</a> specifications when defining the
method-specific DID Syntax are as follows:
      <p>

      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST define exactly one method-specific <a>DID
scheme</a> that is identified by exactly one method name as specified by the
<code>method-name</code> rule in <a href="#did-syntax"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how to generate the
<code>method-specific-id</code> component of a <a>DID</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST define sensitivity and normalization of
the value of the <code>method-specific-id</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
The <code>method-specific-id</code> value MUST be unique within a <a>DID
method</a>. The <code>method-specific-id</code> value itself might be globally
unique.
        </li>
        <li>
Any <a>DID</a> generated by a <a>DID method</a> MUST be globally unique.
        </li>
        <li>
To reduce the chances of <code>method-name</code> conflicts, a <a>DID method</a>
specification SHOULD be registered in the DID Specification Registries
[[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> MAY define multiple <code>method-specific-id</code> formats.
        </li>
        <li>
The <code>method-specific-id</code> format MAY include colons. The use of
colons MUST comply syntactically with the <code>method-specific-id</code> ABNF
rule.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID paths</a>
that are more restrictive than the generic rules in <a href="#path"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID queries</a>
that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID
fragments</a> that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="note" title="Colons in method-specific-id">
The meaning of colons in the <code>method-specific-id</code> is entirely
method-specific. Colons might be used by <a>DID methods</a> for establishing
hierarchically partitioned namespaces, for identifying specific instances or
parts of the <a>verifiable data registry</a>, or for other purposes.
Implementers are advised to avoid assuming any meanings or
behaviors associated with a colon that are generically applicable to all
<a>DID methods</a>.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Method Operations</h2>

      <p>
The requirements for all <a>DID method</a> specifications when defining the
method operations are as follows:
      <p>

      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST define how authorization is performed to
execute all operations, including any necessary cryptographic processes.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a <a>DID controller</a>
creates a <a>DID</a> and its associated <a>DID document</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a <a>DID resolver</a> uses a
<a>DID</a> to resolve a <a>DID document</a>, including how the <a>DID
resolver</a> can verify the authenticity of the response.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify what constitutes an update to a
<a>DID document</a> and how a <a>DID controller</a> can update a <a>DID
document</a> <em>or</em> state that updates are not possible.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a <a>DID controller</a> can
deactivate a <a>DID</a> <em>or</em> state that deactivation is not possible.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
The authority of a party that is performing authorization to carry out the
operations is specific to a <a>DID method</a>. For example, a <a>DID method</a>
might &mdash;
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
make use of the <code><a>controller</a></code> property.
        </li>
        <li>
use the <a>verification methods</a> listed under
<code><a>authentication</a></code>.
        </li>
        <li>
use other constructs in the <a>DID Document</a> such as the <a>verification
method</a> specified via the <code><a>capabilityInvocation</a></code>
<a>verification relationship</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
not use the <a>DID document</a> for this decision at all, and depend on an
out-of-band mechanism, instead.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security Requirements</h2>

      <p>
The requirements for all <a>DID method</a> specifications when authoring the
<em>Security Considerations</em> section are as follows:
      <p>

      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specifications MUST follow all guidelines and normative
language provided in <a data-cite="RFC3552#section-5">RFC3552: Writing Security
Considerations Sections</a> for the <a>DID</a> operations defined in the <a>DID
method</a> specification.
        </li>
        <li>
The Security Considerations section MUST document the following forms of attack
for the <a>DID</a> operations defined in the <a>DID method</a> specification:
eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, denial of
service, storage or network amplification, and man-in-the-middle. Other known
forms of attack SHOULD also be documented.
        </li>
        <li>
The Security Considerations section MUST discuss residual risks, such as the
risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation, or cipher
after threat mitigation was deployed.
        </li>
        <li>
The Security Considerations section MUST provide integrity protection and update
authentication for all operations required by Section <a
href="#method-operations"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
If authentication is involved, particularly user-host authentication, the
security characteristics of the authentication method MUST be clearly
documented.
        </li>
        <li>
The Security Considerations section MUST discuss the policy mechanism by which
<a>DIDs</a> are proven to be uniquely assigned.
        </li>
        <li>
Method-specific endpoint authentication MUST be discussed. Where <a>DID
methods</a> make use of <a>DLTs</a> with varying network topology, sometimes
offered as <em>light node</em> or <em>
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security">thin client</a></em>
implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security assumptions
of the topology available to implementations of the <a>DID method</a> MUST be
discussed.
        </li>
        <li>
If a protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, the <a>DID
method</a> specification MUST clearly indicate which portions of the data are
protected and by what protections, and it SHOULD give an indication of the
sorts of attacks to which the cryptographic protection is susceptible. Some
examples are integrity only, confidentiality, and endpoint authentication.
        </li>
        <li>
Data which is to be held secret (keying material, random seeds, and so on)
SHOULD be clearly labeled.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>DID method</a> specifications SHOULD explain and specify the implementation
of signatures on <a>DID documents</a>, if applicable.
        </li>
        <li>
Where <a>DID methods</a> use peer-to-peer computing resources, such as with all
known <a>DLTs</a>, the expected burdens of those resources SHOULD be discussed
in relation to denial of service.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>DID methods</a> that introduce new authentication <a>service</a>
types, as described in <a href="#services"></a>, SHOULD consider the
security requirements of the supported authentication protocol.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class='normative'>
      <h2>Privacy Requirements</h2>

      <p>
The requirements for all <a>DID method</a> specifications when authoring the
<em>Privacy Considerations</em> section are:
      <p>

      <ol>
        <li>
The <a>DID method</a> specification's Privacy Considerations section MUST
discuss any subsection of Section 5 of [[RFC6973]] that could apply in a
method-specific manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored
data compromise, unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation,
identification, secondary use, disclosure, and exclusion.

During the Working Draft stage, this section focuses on security topics that
should be important in early implementations. The editors are seeking feedback
on threats and threat mitigations that should be reflected in this section or
elsewhere in the spec. <a>DIDs</a> are designed to operate under the general

      <h2>Choosing DID Resolvers</h2>

      <p>
The DID Method Registry (see [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]) contains an informative
list of <a>DID method</a> names and their corresponding <a>DID method</a>
specifications. Implementers need to bear in mind that there is no central
authority to mandate which <a>DID method</a> specification is to be used with
any specific <a>DID method</a> name, but can use the DID Method Registry to make
an informed decision when choosing which <a>DID resolver</a> implementations to
use.

        <h3>Proving Control of a DID and DID Document</h3>

        <p class="issue" data-number="583">
This section is inaccurate and needs revision.
        </p>

        <p>
Signatures and <a>verifiable timestamps</a> allow <a>DID documents</a> to be
cryptographically verifiable.
        </p>

        <p>
By itself, a verified signature on a self-signed <a>DID document</a> does not
prove control of a <a>DID</a>. It only proves that the:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
<a>DID document</a> was not tampered with since it was timestamped.
          </li>

          <li>
<a>DID controller(s)</a> controlled the private key used for the signature at
the time the timestamp was created.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
Proving control of a <a>DID</a>, that is, the <a>binding</a> between the <a>DID</a>
and the <a>DID document</a> that describes it, requires a two step process:
        </p>

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
Resolving the <a>DID</a> to a <a>DID document</a> according to its
<a>DID method</a> specification.
          </li>

          <li>
Verifying that the <code><a>id</a></code> property of the resulting <a>DID
document</a> matches the <a>DID</a> that was resolved.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
It should be noted that this process proves control of a <a>DID</a> and
<a>DID document</a> regardless of whether the <a>DID document</a> is signed.
        </p>

        <p>
Signatures on <a>DID documents</a> are optional. <a>DID method</a>
specifications are expected to explain and specify their implementation if
applicable.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Proving Control of a Public Key</h3>

        <p class="issue" data-number="583">
This section is inaccurate and needs revision.
        </p>

        <p>
There are two methods for proving control of the private key corresponding to a
<a>public key description</a> in the <a>DID document</a>: static and dynamic.
        </p>

        <p>
The static method is to sign the <a>DID document</a> with the private key. This
proves control of the private key at a time no later than the
<a>DID document</a> was registered. If the <a>DID document</a> is not signed,
control of a public key described in the <a>DID document</a> can still be proven
dynamically as follows:
        </p>

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
Send a challenge message containing a <a>public key description</a> from the
<a>DID document</a> and a nonce to an appropriate <a>service endpoint</a>
described in the <a>DID document</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
Verify the signature of the response message against the
<a>public key description</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Real-World Identity</h3>

        <p>
A <a>DID</a> and <a>DID document</a> do not inherently carry any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">
personal data</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
It can be useful to express a binding of <a>DID</a> to a person's or company's
real world identity, in a way that is provably asserted by a trusted authority
such as a government. This can enable interactions that can be considered
legally valid under one or more jurisdictions; establishing such bindings has to
be carefully balanced against privacy considerations (see <a
href="#privacy-considerations"></a>).
        </p>

        <p>
The process of binding a <a>DID</a> to something in the real world, such as a
person or a company, for example using <a>verifiable credentials</a> with the
same subject as that <a>DID</a>, is out of scope for this specification. For
more information, see the Verifiable Credentials Data Model [[VC-DATA-MODEL]].

      <h2>Authentication Service Endpoints</h2>

      <p>
If a <a>DID document</a> publishes a <a>service</a> intended for
authentication or authorization of the <a>DID subject</a> (see Section <a
href="#services"></a>), it is the responsibility of the <a>service
endpoint</a> provider, subject, or requesting party to comply with the
requirements of the authentication protocols supported at that <a>service
endpoint</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Non-Repudiation</h2>

      <p>
Non-repudiation of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID document</a> updates is supported
under the assumption that the subject:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Is monitoring for unauthorized updates (see Section
<a href="#notification-of-did-document-changes"></a>).
        </li>
        <li>
Has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious updates according to the
access control mechanism for the <a>DID method</a> (see Section
<a href="#authentication"></a>).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
Non-repudiation is further supported if timestamps are included (see Section
<a href="#did-document-metadata"></a>) and the target <a>DLT</a>
system supports timestamps.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Notification of DID Document Changes</h2>

      <p>
One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a <a>DID document</a> is
monitoring and actively notifying the <a>DID subject</a> when there are changes.
This is analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to the email
addresses on file.
      </p>
      <p>
In the case of a <a>DID</a>, there is no intermediary registrar or account
provider to generate such notifications. However, if the <a>verifiable data
registry</a> on which the <a>DID</a> is registered directly supports change
notifications, a subscription service can be offered to <a>DID controllers</a>.
Notifications could be sent directly to the relevant <a>service endpoints</a>
listed in an existing <a>DID</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
If a <a>DID controller</a> chooses to rely on a third-party monitoring service
(other than the <a>verifiable data registry</a> itself), this introduces another
vector of attack.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key and Signature Expiration</h2>

      <p>
In a <a>decentralized identifier</a> architecture, there are no centralized
authorities to enforce key or signature expiration policies. Therefore
<a>DID resolvers</a> and requesting parties need to validate that keys
were not expired at the time they were used. Because some use cases have
legitimate reasons why already-expired keys can be extended, make sure key
expiration does not prevent any further use of the key. Implementations
of a resolver ought to be compatible with such extension behavior.

      <h2>Verification Method Rotation</h2>

      <p>Verification method rotation is a proactive security measure.</p>

      <p>
        Verification method rotation applies only to the current or latest
        version of a DID Document.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a verification method has been active for a long time, or used
        for many operations, a controller might wish to perform a rotation.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
        It is considered a best practice to perform verification method
        rotation on a regular basis.
      </p>


      <p class="advisement">
        Proofs or signatures that rely on verification methods that are not
        present in the latest version of a DID Document are not impacted by
        rotation, and might require additional information to mitigate compromise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Section <a href="#method-operations"></a> specifies the
        <a>DID</a> operations to be supported by a
        <a>DID method</a> specification, including
        <a href="#method-operations">update</a>
        which is expected to be used to perform a verification method rotation.
      </p>

      <p>
        A controller performs a rotation when they add a new verification
        method that is meant to replace an existing verification method after
        some time.
      </p>

      <p>Not all DID Methods support verification method rotation.</p>

      <p>
        Rotation is a key management process that enables the private cryptographic
        material associated with an existing verification method to be deactivated
        or destroyed once a new verification method has been added to the DID
        Document. Going forward, any new proofs that a controller would have generated
        using the old cryptographic material can now instead be generated using the new
        material and can be verified using the new verification method.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rotation is a useful mechanism for protecting against verification
        method compromise, since frequent rotation of a verification method by
        the controller reduces the value of a single compromised verification method
        to an attacker. Performing revocation immediately after rotation is
        useful for verification methods that a controller designates for
        short-lived verifications, such as those involved in encrypting messages
        and authentication.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Higher security environments tend to employ more frequent verification
        method rotation.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Frequent rotation of a verification method might be frustrating for
        parties that are forced to continuously renew or refresh associated
        credentials.

    <section>

      <h2>Verification Method Revocation</h2>

      <p>
Verification method revocation is a reactive security measure.
      </p>

      <p>
Verification method revocation applies only to the current or latest
version of a DID Document.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a verification method is no longer exclusively accessible to the
        controller or parties trusted to act on behalf of the controller, it
        is expected to be revoked immediately to reduce the risk of masquerading, theft,
        and fraud.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
It is considered a best practice to support key revocation.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
A controller is expected to immediately revoke any verification method that is believed to
be compromised.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
Revocation is expected to be understood as a controller expressing
that proofs or signatures associated with a revoked verification method
might have been created by an attacker. Verifiers, however, might
still choose to accept or reject such proofs or signatures at their
own discretion.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
As described in <a href="#verification-material"></a>,
absence of a verification method is the only form of revocation that
applies to all DID Methods.
      </p>

      <p>
<a href="#method-operations"></a> specifies the <a>DID</a> operations to be
supported by a <a>DID method</a> specification, including <a
href="#method-operations">update</a> and <a href="#method-operations">
deactivate</a> which might be used to remove verification method from a DID
Document.
      </p>

      <p>
Not all DID Methods support verification method revocation.
      </p>

      <p>
Even if a verification method is present in a DID Document, additional
information, such as a public key revocation certificate, or an external
allow or deny list, might be used to determine whether a verification
method has been revoked.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
Compromise of the secrets associated with a verification method
allows the attacker to use them according to the verification
relationship expressed by controller in the DID Document, for
example, for authentication. The attacker's use of the secrets might
be indistinguishable from the legitimate controller's use starting
from the time the verification method was registered, to the time it
was revoked.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
The day-to-day operation of any software relying on a compromised verification
method, such as an individual's operating system, antivirus, or endpoint protection
software, might be impacted when the verification method is publicly revoked.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
Although verifiers might choose not to accept proofs or signatures from a revoked verification method,
knowing whether a verification was made with a revoked verification method is trickier than it might seem.
Some DID methods provide the ability to look back at the state of a DID at a point in time,
or at a particular version of the DID document. When such a feature is
combined with a reliable way to determine the time or DID version that existed
when a cryptographically verifiable statement was made, then revocation
does not undo that statement. This can be the basis for using DIDs to make
binding commitments (e.g., to sign a mortgage).
<br><br>
If these conditions are met, revocation is not retroactive; it only nullifies future use of the method.
<br/><br/>
However, in order for such semantics to be safe, the second condition &mdash;
an ability to know what the state of the DID document was at the time the
assertion was made &mdash; is expected to apply. Without that guarantee, someone
could discover a revoked key and use it to make cryptographically
verifiable statements with a simulated date in the past.
<br/><br/>
Some DID methods only allow the retrieval of the current state of a DID.
When this is true, or when the state of a DID at the time of
cryptographically verifiable statement cannot be reliably determined,
then the only safe interpretation of revocation is to make it
apply both forward and backward in time. DID ecosystems that
take this approach essentially provide cryptographically verifiable
statements as ephemeral tokens that can be invalidated at any time by
the DID controller.
      </p>
    </section>


    <div class="note">
      <p>
Trustless systems are those where all trust is derived from cryptographically
provable assertions, and more specifically, where no metadata outside of the
cryptographic system is factored into the determination of trust in the system.
To verify a signature of proof for a verification method which has been revoked
in a trustless system, a DID method needs to support either or both of the
`versionId` or `versionTime`, as well as both the `updated` and `nextUpdate`,
DID document metadata properties. A verifier can validate a signature or proof
of a revoked key if and only if all of the following are true:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
The proof or signature includes the `versionId` or `versionTime` of the DID
document that was used at the point the signature or proof was created.
        </li>
        <li>
The verifier can determine the point in time at which the signature or proof
was made, e.g., it was anchored on a blockchain.
        </li>
        <li>
For the resolved DID document metadata, the `updated` timestamp is before, and
the `nextUpdate` timestamp is after, the point in time at which the signature or
proof was made.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>DID Recovery</h2>

      <p>
        Recovery is a reactive security measure, whereby a controller is able
        to regain the ability to perform DID operations.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
        Recovery is advised when a controller or services trusted to act on
        their behalf no longer have the exclusive ability to perform DID
        operations as described in <a href="#method-operations"></a>.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
        It is considered a best practice to never reuse a verification method
        or key material associated with recovery for any other purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recovery is commonly performed in conjunction with
        <a href="#verification-method-rotation">verification method rotation</a>
<!--FIXME: Add link to section when section becomes merged -->
        and verification method revocation.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are no common recovery mechanisms that apply to all DID Methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a>DID method</a> specifications might choose to enable support for a
        quorum of trusted parties to facilitate recovery. Some of the
        facilities to do so are suggested in Section
        <a href="#did-controller"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not all <a>DID method</a> specifications will recognize control from
        <a>DIDs</a> registered using other <a>DID methods</a> and they might
        restrict third-party control to <a>DIDs</a> that use the same method.
      </p>

      <p>
        Access control and recovery in a <a>DID method</a>
        specification can also include a time lock feature to protect against
        key compromise by maintaining a second track of control for recovery.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Performing recovery proactively on an infrequent but regular basis,
        can help to ensure that control has not been lost.

      <h2>The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers</h2>

      <p>
<a>DIDs</a> achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central
registration authority. This comes at the cost of human memorability.
The algorithms capable of generating globally unique identifiers
produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning (see also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko's
Triangle</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
There are use cases where it is desirable to discover a <a>DID</a> when
starting from a human-friendly identifier. For example, a natural language
name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a <a>DID controller</a>,
such as a mobile telephone number, email address, social media username, or
blog URL. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to
<a>DIDs</a> (and doing so in a way that can be verified and trusted) is
outside the scope of this specification.
      </p>

      <p>
Solutions to this problem should be defined in separate specifications that
reference this specification. It is strongly recommended that such
specifications carefully consider the:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly
identifier for a target entity.
        </li>
        <li>
Privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently
correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
A draft specification for discovering a <a>DID</a> from domain names and email
addresses using DNS lookups is available at [[?DNS-DID]].

    <section>
      <h2>DIDs as Enhanced URNs</h2>

      <p>
If desired by a <a>DID controller</a>, a <a>DID</a> is capable of acting
as an enhanced Uniform Resource Name (URN) as defined by [[RFC8141]], i.e.,
"a persistent, location-independent resource identifier". <a>DIDs</a> used in
this way provide a cryptographically secure, location-independent identifier for
a digital resource, while also providing metadata that enables retrieval.
Because of the indirection between the <a>DID document</a> and the <a>DID</a>
itself, the <a>DID controller</a> can adjust the actual location of the resource
&mdash; or even provide the resource directly &mdash; without adjusting the
<a>DID</a>. <a>DIDs</a> of this type can definitively verify that the resource
retrieved is, in fact, the resource identified.
      </p>
      <p>
A <a>DID controller</a> who intends to use a <a>DID</a> for this purpose is
advised to follow the security considerations in [[RFC8141]]. In particular:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
The <a>DID controller</a> is expected to choose a <a>DID method</a> that
supports the controller's requirements for persistence. The Decentralized
Characteristics Rubric [[?DID-RUBRIC]] is one tool available to help
implementers decide upon the most suitable <a>DID method</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>DID controller</a> is expected to publish its operational policies so
relying parties can determine the degree to which they can rely on the
persistence of a <a>DID</a> controlled by that <a>DID controller</a>. In the
absence of such policies, relying parties are not expected to make any
assumption about whether a <a>DID</a> is a persistent identifier for the same
<a>DID subject</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Immutability</h2>

      <p>
Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and the
assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Immutability of <a>DID documents</a> can
provide some security benefits. Individual <a>DID methods</a> ought to
consider constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics they do not
need. The more <em>locked down</em> a <a>DID method</a> is, while providing
the same set of features, the less it can be manipulated by malicious actors.
      </p>
      <p>
As an example, consider that a single edit to a <a>DID document</a> can change
anything except the root <code><a>id</a></code> property of the document. But
is it actually desirable for a <a>service</a> to change its
<code>type</code> after it is defined? Or for a key to change its value? Or
would it be better to require a new <code><a>id</a></code> when certain
fundamental properties of an object change? Malicious takeovers of a website
often aim for an outcome where the site keeps its identifier (the host name),
but is subtly changed underneath. If certain properties of the site were
required by the specification to be immutable (for example, the <a
target="_blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">ASN</a>
associated with its IP address), such attacks might be much harder and more
expensive to carry out, and anomaly detection would be easier.
      </p>
      <p>
For <a>DID methods</a> tied to a global source of truth, a direct,
just-in-time lookup of the latest version of a <a>DID document</a> is always
possible. However, it seems likely that layers of cache might eventually sit
between a <a>DID resolver</a> and that source of truth. If they do, believing
the attributes of an object in the <a>DID document</a> to have a given state
when they are actually subtly different might invite exploits. This is
particularly true if some lookups are of a full <a>DID document</a>, and
others are of partial data where the larger context is assumed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Encrypted Data in DID Documents</h2>
      <p>
Encryption algorithms have been known to fail due to advances in cryptography
and computing power. Implementers are advised to assume that any encrypted
data placed in a <a>DID document</a> might eventually be made available in
clear text to the same audience to which the encrypted data is available.
This is particularly pertinent if the <a>DID document</a> is public.
      </p>
      <p>
Encrypting all or parts of <a>DID documents</a> is <em>not</em> an appropriate means
to protect data in the long term. Similarly, placing encrypted data in <a>DID
documents</a> is not an appropriate means to include personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
Given the caveats above, if encrypted data is included in a <a>DID document</a>,
implementers are advised to not encrypt with the public keys of entities that
do not wish to be correlated with the <a>DID</a>.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Equivalence Properties</h2>
      <p>
The three equivalence properties—<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code>, <code><a>equivalentId</a></code>, and
<code><a>canonicalId</a></code>—are subject to special security considerations
related to attacks against <a>DIDs</a> that are asserted to be equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
The <code><a>equivalentId</a></code> and <code><a>canonicalId</a></code>
properties that constrain equivalence assertions to variants of a single <a>DID</a>
produced by the same <a>DID method</a> (e.g., <code>did:foo:123</code> ≡
<code>did:foo:hash(123)</code>) can be trusted to the extent the requesting party
trusts the <a>DID method</a> (and a conforming producer) itself.
      </p>
      <p>
The <code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> property that permits an equivalence
assertion to <a>URIs</a> that are not governed by the same <a>DID method</a> (or may
not be <a>DIDs</a> at all) cannot be trusted without performing verification steps
outside of the governing <a>DID method</a>. See additional guidance in
<a href="#also-known-as"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
As with any other sensitive properties in the <a>DID document</a> (e.g., public key
references), parties relying on any equivalence statement in a <a>DID document</a>
should guard against the values of these properties being substituted by an
attacker after the proper verification has been performed. Any write access to a
<a>DID document</a> stored in memory or disk after verification has been performed is
an attack vector that will circumvent verification unless the <a>DID document</a> is
re-verified.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Content Integrity Protection</h2>
      <p>
<a>DID documents</a> which include external JSON-LD contexts (see
<a href="#json-ld"></a>) or any other links to external machine-readable
content are vulnerable to tampering.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DID document</a> consumers can cache local static copies of JSON-LD contexts
and/or verify the integrity of external contexts against the cryptographic
hash for the context as registered in the DID Specification Registries
(see the registration process for more detail) [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Persistence</h2>
      <p>
DIDs are designed to be persistent such that a controller need not rely
upon a single trusted third party or administrator to maintain their
identifiers. No administrator can take control away from the controller,
nor can an administrator prevent their identifiers' use for any particular
purpose such as authentication, authorization, and attestation. No
third party can act on behalf of a controller to remove or render
inoperable an individual's (or an organization's) identifier without the
controller's consent.
      </p>
      <p>
However, it is important to note that in all DID Methods that enable
cryptographic proof-of-control, the means of proving control can always be
transferred to another party by transferring the cryptographic secrets.
Therefore, it is vital that systems relying on the persistence of an
identifier over time regularly check to ensure that the identifier is, in
fact, still under the control of the intended party.
      </p>
      <p>
Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine from the cryptography alone
whether or not the private key material associated with a given proof
mechanism has been compromised. It might well be that the expected controller
still has access to the private keys &mdash; and as such can execute a
proof-of-control as part of a verification process &mdash; while at the same time,
a bad actor also has access to (or a copy of) those same keys.
      </p>
      <p>
As such, cryptographic proof-of-control is expected to only be used as one
factor in evaluating the level of identity assurance for a given
service. DID-based authentication provides much greater assurance than a
username and password, thanks to the ability to determine control over
a secret without transmitting that secret between systems. However, it is
not infallible. Services that perform sensitive, high value, or
life-critical operations should use additional factors as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
In addition to potential ambiguity from use by different controllers,
it is impossible to guarantee, in general, that a given DID is being used
in reference to the same subject at any given point in time. It is
technically possible for the controller to reuse a DID for different
subjects and, more subtly, for the precise definition of the Subject
to either change over time or be misunderstood.
      </p>
      <p>
For example, consider a DID used for a sole proprietorship, receiving
various credentials used for financial transactions. To the controller,
that identifier referred to the business. As the business grows, it
eventually gets incorporated as an LLC. The controller continues using
that same DID, because to <strong>them</strong> the DID refers to the
business. However, to the state, the tax authority, and the local
municipality, the DID no longer refers to the same entity. Whether or
not the subtle shift in meaning matters to a credit provider or supplier
is necessarily up to them to decide. In many cases, as long as the bills
get paid and collections can be enforced, the shift is immaterial.
      </p>
      <p>
Because of these potential ambiguities, DIDs should be considered valid
<em>contextually</em> rather than absolutely. Their persistence does not
imply that they refer to the exact same Subject, nor that they are under the
control of the same controller. Instead, one needs to understand the context
in which the DID was created, how it is used, and consider the likely
shifts in their meaning, and adopt procedures and policies to address both
potential and inevitable semantic drift.

      <h2>Level of Assurance</h2>

      <p>
Additional information about the security context of authentication events
is often required for compliance reasons, especially in regulated areas
such as the financial and public sectors. Examples include but are not
limited to protection of secret keys, the identity proofing process, and the
form-factor of the authenticator. For example, <a target="_blank"
href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en">
Payment services (PSD 2)</a> and <a target="_blank"
href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG">
eIDAS</a> introduce such requirements to the security context. Level of
Assurance (LoA) frameworks are classified and defined by, for example,
<a target="_blank"
href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG">
eIDAS</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">
NIST 800-63-3</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/45138.html">
ISO/IEC 29115:2013</a>, including their requirements for the security
context, and making recommendations on how to achieve them. This might
include strong user authentication and <a target="_blank"
href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2">FIDO2</a>/<a target="_blank"
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">WebAuthn</a> can be potential
implementations. A LoA represents the level of confidence that an entity is in
fact that entity. Some regulated use cases require the implementation of a
certain LoA. Since <a>verification relationships</a> such as <code>
<a>assertionMethod</a></code> and <code><a>authentication</a></code> might be
used in some of these use cases, information about the applied security context
might need to be expressed and provided to a <em>verifier</em>.
Whether and how to encode this information in the <a>DID document</a> data model
is out of scope for this specification, but it should be noted that the <a>DID
document</a> data model can be extended if necessary (see <a
href="#extensibility">Extensibility</a> section). Section <a
href="#privacy-considerations">Privacy Considerations</a> remains applicable for
such extensions.

    <h1>Privacy Considerations</h1>

    <p>
It is critically important to apply the principles of Privacy by Design
[[PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN]] to all aspects of the <a>decentralized identifier</a>
architecture, because <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> are, by design,
administered directly by the <a>DID controller(s)</a>. There is no registrar,
hosting company, or other intermediate service provider to recommend or apply
additional privacy safeguards. The authors of this specification have applied
all seven Privacy by Design principles throughout its development.
Privacy in this specification is preventative not remedial, and privacy is an
embedded default.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Keep Personal Data Private</h2>

      <p>
If a <a>DID method</a> specification is written for a public <a>verifiable
data registry</a> where all <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> are publicly
available, it is <em>critical</em> that <a>DID documents</a> contain no
personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
Personal data can instead be placed behind <a>service
endpoints</a> under control of the <a>DID subject</a> or <a>DID controller</a>.
Due diligence should be taken around the use of URLs in <a>service endpoints</a>
to prevent leakage of personal data or correlation within a URL
of a <a>service endpoint</a>. For example, a URL that contains a username is
dangerous to include in a <a>DID Document</a> because the username is likely
to be human-meaningful in a way that can reveal information
that the <a>DID subject</a> did not consent to sharing. With this privacy
architecture, personal data can be exchanged on a private, peer-to-peer basis
using communications channels identified and secured by <a>public key
descriptions</a> in <a>DID documents</a>. This also enables <a>DID
subjects</a> and requesting parties to implement the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">right to be
forgotten</a>, because no personal data is written to an immutable
<a>distributed ledger</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DID Correlation Risks and Pseudonymous DIDs</h2>

      <p>
Like any type of globally unique identifier, <a>DIDs</a> might be used for
correlation. <a>DID controllers</a> can mitigate this privacy risk by using
pairwise unique <a>DIDs</a>, that is, sharing a different private <a>DID</a> for
every relationship. In effect, each <a>DID</a> acts as a pseudonym. A
pseudonymous <a>DID</a> need only be shared with more than one party when
the <a>DID subject</a> explicitly authorizes correlation between those parties.
If pseudonymous <a>DIDs</a> are the default, then the only need for a public
<a>DID</a> (a <a>DID</a> published openly or shared with a large number of
parties) is when the <a>DID subject</a> explicitly desires public
identification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DID Document Correlation Risks</h2>

      <p>
The anti-correlation protections of pseudonymous <a>DIDs</a> are easily defeated
if the data in the corresponding <a>DID documents</a> can be correlated. For
example, using same <a>public key descriptions</a> or bespoke
<a>service endpoints</a> in multiple <a>DID documents</a> can provide as much
correlation information as using the same <a>DID</a>. Therefore the
<a>DID document</a> for a pseudonymous <a>DID</a> also needs to use pairwise
unique public keys.

It might seem natural to also use pairwise unique <a>service endpoints</a> in
the <a>DID document</a> for a pseudonymous <a>DID</a>. However, unique endpoints
allow all traffic between two <a>DIDs</a> to be isolated perfectly into unique
buckets, where timing correlation and similar analysis is easy. Therefore, a
better strategy for endpoint privacy might be to share an endpoint among
thousands or millions of <a>DIDs</a> controlled by many different subjects.

      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Assigning a type to the DID subject</h2>
      <p>
It is dangerous to add properties to the <a>DID document</a> that can be used
to indicate, explicitly or through inference, what <em>type</em> or nature of
thing the <a>DID subject</a> is, particularly if the <a>DID subject</a> is a
person.
      </p>
      <p>
Not only do such properties potentially result in personal data (see
<a href="#keep-personal-data-private"></a>) or
correlatable data (see <a href="#did-correlation-risks-and-pseudonymous-dids">
</a> and <a href="#did-document-correlation-risks"></a>) being present in the
<a>DID document</a>, but they can be used for grouping particular <a>DIDs</a>
in such a way that they are included in or excluded from certain operations or
functionalities.
      </p>
      <p>
Including <em>type</em> information in a <a>DID Document</a> can
result in personal privacy harms even for <a>DID Subjects</a> that are
non-person entities, such as IoT devices. The aggregation of such
information around a <a>DID Controller</a> could serve as a form of
digital fingerprint and this is best avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
To minimize these risks, all properties in a <a>DID document</a> ought to be
for expressing cryptographic material, endpoints, or <a>verification methods</a>
related to using the <a>DID</a>.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Herd Privacy</h2>

      <p>
When a <a>DID subject</a> is indistinguishable from others in the herd,
privacy is available. When the act of engaging privately with another party is
by itself a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID
methods</a> need to work to improve herd privacy, particularly for those who
legitimately need it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces that
default to preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. To reduce <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">digital
fingerprints</a>, share common settings across requesting party
implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum on wire protocols, use
encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to standard lengths.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Service Privacy</h2>
      <p>
The ability for a controller to optionally state at least one <a>service endpoint</a>
in the <a>DID document</a> increases their control and agency. Each additional
endpoint in the <a>DID document</a> adds privacy risk either due to correlation
(e.g., across endpoint descriptions) or because the <a>services</a> are not
protected by an authorization mechanism, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DID documents</a> are often public and will be stored and indexed efficiently by
their very standards-based nature. This risk is worse if <a>DID documents</a> are
published to immutable Verifiable Data Registries. Access to a history of the
<a>DID documents</a> referenced by a <a>DID</a> represents a form of traffic analysis made
more efficient through the use of standards.
      </p>
      <p>
The degree of additional privacy risk caused by using multiple <a>service
endpoints</a> in one <a>DID document</a> can be difficult to estimate. Privacy
harms are typically unintended consequences. <a>DIDs</a> can identify documents,
<a>services</a>, schemas, and other things that may be associated
with individual people, households, clubs, and employers &mdash; and
correlation of their <a>service endpoints</a> could become a powerful
surveillance and inference tool. An example of this is that including multiple common country-level top level domain such as <code>https://example.co.uk</code> could be used to infer the approximate location of the <a>DID Subject</a> with a greater degree of probability.
      </p>
      <p>
The variety of possible endpoints makes it particularly challenging to maintain
herd privacy, in which no information about the <a>DID subject</a> is leaked.
      </p>
      <p>
First, because service endpoints may be specified as <a>URIs</a>, they could
unintentionally leak personal information because of the architecture of the service.
For example, a service endpoint of <code>http://example.com/MyFirstName</code> is leaking the term
<code>MyFirstName</code> to everyone who can access the DID Document. When linking to legacy systems,
this is an unavoidable risk and care should be taken in such cases. We encourage new,
DID-aware endpoints to use nothing more than the DID itself for any identification necessary,
e.g., <code>http://example.com/did%3Aexample%3Aabc123</code>. Since that <code>did:example:abc123</code> is already
exposed in the DID Document, it leaks no additional information.
      </p>

      <p>
Second, because a <a>DID document</a> can list multiple service endpoints, it is possible to
irreversibly associate services that are not associated in any other context. This
correlation on its own may lead to de-anonymization, revealing information about the
<a>DID subject</a> even if the <a>URIs</a> used did not.
      </p>
      <p>
Third, because some types of <a>DID subjects</a> may be more or less likely to list specific
endpoints, e.g., a <a>DID</a> for an automobile may include a pointer to a public title
record at the Department of Motor Vehicles, while a <a>DID</a> for an individual would not.
As such, the listing of a given service could, by itself, leak information that can
be used to infer something about the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
It is the goal of herd privacy to ensure that the nature of specific subjects is
obscured by the population of the whole. To maximize herd privacy, implementers
need to rely on one &mdash; and only one &mdash; service endpoint, with that endpoint providing
a proxy or mediator service that the controller is willing to depend on to protect
such associations and that blinds requests to the ultimate service.
      </p>
      <p>
Torward this end, consider any of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Negotiator Endpoint</strong> &mdash; Service for negotiating mutually
agreeable communications channels, preferably using private set intersection. The
output of negotiation is a communication channel and whatever credentials may be
needed to access it.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Tor Endpoint</strong> (<a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/history/">Tor Onion Router</a>) &mdash;
Provide a privacy-respecting address for reaching service endpoints. Any service that
can be provided online can be provided through TOR for additional privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Mediator Endpoint</strong> &mdash;
<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/720bdab50e2d0437fda03028c1b17c69781bdd69/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays/README.md">Mediators</a>
provide a generic endpoint, for multiple parties, receive encrypted messages on
behalf of those parties, and forward
them to the intended recipient. This avoids the need to have a specific endpoint per subject, which could create a
correlation risk. Also called a proxy.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Confidential Storage</strong> &mdash; Proprietary or confidential personal
information may need to be kept off-registry to provide additional privacy and/or
security guarantees, especially for those methods where <a>DID documents</a> are published
on a public ledger. Pointing to external resource services provides a means for
authorization checks and deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Polymorphic Proxy</strong> &mdash; A proxy endpoint that can act as any
number of services, depending on how it is called. For example, the same URL could
be used for both negotiator and mediator functions, depending on a mechanism for re-routing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
These service endpoint types continue to be an area of innovation.

    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions about DID Identification</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>What types of resources can a DID identify?</h2>
      <p>
Since a <a>DID</a> is a specific type of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier),
the answer to this question is provided by section 1.1 of the URI
specification [[!RFC3986]]:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
This specification does not limit the scope of what might be a resource;
rather, the term "resource" is used in a general sense for whatever might be
identified by a URI. Familiar examples include an electronic document, an
image, a source of information with a consistent purpose (e.g., "today's
weather report for Los Angeles"), a service (e.g., an HTTP-to-SMS gateway),
and a collection of other resources.  A resource is not necessarily
accessible via the Internet; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound
books in a library can also be resources.  Likewise, abstract concepts can
be resources, such as the operators and operands of a mathematical equation,
the types of a relationship (e.g., "parent" or "employee"), or numeric
values (e.g., zero, one, and infinity).
      </blockquote>
      <p>
In other words, it does not matter whether a resource is "on" or "off" the
Internet—if it can be identified, it can be assigned a URI, and therefore it
can be assigned a <a>DID</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How do you know what a DID identifies?</h2>
      <p>
For any <a>DID</a>, the <a>DID controller</a> determines the <a>DID subject</a>.
It is not expected to be possible to determine the <a>DID subject</a>
from looking at the <a>DID</a> itself. The reason is that, in order to satisfy
several core properties of a <a>DID</a> as an identifier—especially
decentralization and cryptographic verifiability—<a>DIDs</a> are generally
only meaningful to machines, not humans. To illustrate, compare the following
two URIs:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/WorkMode/getting-started</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1j</code>
      </p>
      <p>
The first is the URL of the Getting Started page of the W3C DID Working
Group. This is a human-meaningful identifier (at least to someone who
understands the English language). In this sense, the reader can be said to
"know" what the URL identifies without having to dereference it (provided
the reader trusts the publisher of the URL).
      </p>
      <p>
The second URI—the example <a>DID</a>—is meaningless to humans no matter what
language you speak. What it identifies is anyone’s guess in the absence of
further information describing the <a>DID subject</a>. So further information
about the <a>DID subject</a> is only discoverable by resolving the <a>DID</a>
to the <a>DID document</a>, obtaining a verifiable credential about the
<a>DID</a>, or via some other description of the <a>DID</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Does the DID identify the DID document?</h2>
      <p>
No. To be very precise, the <a>DID</a> identifies the <a>DID subject</a> and
<em>resolves to</em> the <a>DID document</a> (by following the protocol
specified by the <a>DID method</a>). The <a>DID document</a> is not a
separate resource from the <a>DID subject</a> and does not have a URI
separate from the <a>DID</a>. Rather the <a>DID document</a> is an artifact
of <a>DID resolution</a> controlled by the <a>DID controller</a> for the
purpose of describing the <a>DID subject</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
This distinction is illustrated by the graph model shown below.

A <a>DID</a> is an identifier assigned by a <a>DID controller</a> to identify
a <a>DID subject</a> and resolve to a <a>DID document</a> that describes the
<a>DID subject</a>. The <a>DID document</a> is an artifact of <a>DID
resolution</a> and not a separate resource distinct from the <a>DID subject</a>.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>What does the DID document say about the DID subject?</h2>
      <p>
Each property in a <a>DID document</a> is a statement by the
<a>DID controller</a> that refers to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
The string of characters defining identifiers for the <a>DID subject</a>
(e.g., the <code><a>id</a></code> and <code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code>
properties)
        </li>
        <li>
How to interact with the <a>DID subject</a> (e.g., the
<code><a>verificationMethod</a></code> and <code><a>service</a></code>
properties).
        </li>
        <li>
How to interpret the specific representation of the <a>DID document</a>
(e.g., the <code>@context</code> property for a JSON-LD representation).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
There is only one required property in a <a>DID document</a>—the <code><a>id</a></code>
property—so that is the only statement guaranteed to be in a <a>DID document</a>.
That statement is illustrated by the solid red arrow in figure 2 asserting
that the <a>DID</a> identifies the <a>DID subject</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How can you discover more information about the DID subject?</h2>
      <p>
There are two basic options for discovery of more information about the
<a>DID subject</a>. The first option is to request more information from a
<a>service endpoint</a> if one or more are present in the <a>DID document</a>.
An example would be to query a <a>service endpoint</a> that supports
verifiable credentials for one or more claims (attributes) describing the
<a>DID subject</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
A second option is to use the <code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> property if it
is present in the <a>DID document</a>. The <a>DID controller</a> can use it
to provide a list of other URIs (including other <a>DIDs</a>) that identify
the same <a>DID subject</a>. Resolving or dereferencing these URIs might yield
other descriptions or representations of the <a>DID subject</a> as
illustrated in the figure below.
      </p>
      <figure id="alsoKnownAs-graph">

          DID subject.
        " >
        <figcaption>

      <p>
This mechanism is how DID identification can fulfill guidance from the W3C
in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/">Cool URIs for the Semantic Web</a>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
Given only a URI, machines and people should be able to retrieve a
description about the resource identified by the URI from the Web. Such
a look-up mechanism is important to establish shared understanding of
what a URI identifies. Machines should get RDF data and humans should
get a readable representation, such as HTML.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
Note that it is not required that a <a>DID document</a> use an
RDF-based representation; see <a href="#representations"></a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Can the DID document serve as a representation of the DID subject?</h2>
      <p>
If the <a>DID subject</a> is a digital resource that can be retrieved
from the Internet, then yes, the <a>DID document</a> can serve as a
representation of the <a>DID subject</a>. For example, a data schema that
needs a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier could be
assigned a <a>DID</a>, and its <a>DID document</a> could be used as a
standard way to retrieve a representation of that schema.
      </p>
      <p>
Alternately, a <a>DID</a> can be used to identify a digital resource
that can be returned directly from a <a>verifiable data registry</a> if
that functionality is supported by the applicable <a>DID method</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Can existing web resources also be assigned DIDs?</h2>
      <p>
Yes, if the controller of a web page or any other web resource wants to
assign it a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier, the
controller can give it a <a>DID</a>. For example, the author of a blog
hosted by a blog hosting company (under that hosting company’s own URL)
could create a <a>DID</a> for the blog. In the <a>DID document</a>, the
author can include an alsoKnownAs property pointing to the current URL of
the blog:
      </p>
      <code>
        "alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.blogging-host.example/home"]
      </code>
      <p>
If the author subsequently moves the blog to a different hosting company
(or to the author’s own domain), the author can update the <a>DID document</a>
to point to the new URL for the blog:
      </p>
      <code>
        "alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.example/"]
      </code>
      <p>
The <a>DID</a> effectively adds a layer of indirection for the blog URL.
This layer of indirection is under the control of the author instead of
under the control of an external administrative authority such as the blog
hosting company. This is how a <a>DID</a> can effectively function as an
enhanced <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141">URN (Uniform Resource
Name)</a>—a persistent identifier for an information resource whose network
location might change over time.

      <h2>What is the relationship between DID controllers and DID subjects?</h2>
      <p>
To avoid confusion, it is helpful to classify
<a>DID subject</a>s into two disjoint sets based on their relationship to
the <a>DID controller</a>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Set #1: The DID subject <em>is</em> the DID controller</h3>
        <p>
The first case, shown in figure 4, is the common scenario where the
<a>DID subject</a> is also the <a>DID controller</a>. This is the case when
an individual or organization creates a <a>DID</a> to self-identify.
        </p>
        <figure id="controller-subject-equivalence">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 75%;"
            src="diagrams/figure-b.1-controller-and-subject-equivalence.png" alt="
            Diagram showing the same graph model as figure 2 except with an
            equivalence arc from the DID subject to the DID controller.
          " >
          <figcaption>
The <a>DID subject</a> is the same entity as the <a>DID controller</a>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
From a graph model perspective, even though the nodes identified as the
<a>DID controller</a> and <a>DID subject</a> in figure 4 are distinct,
there is a logical arc connecting them to express a semantic equivalence
relationship. (In RDF/OWL, this is expressed using the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#sameAs-def">
<code>owl:sameAs</code> predicate</a>.)
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Set #2: The DID subject is <em>not</em> the DID controller</h3>
        <p>
The second case is when the <a>DID subject</a> is a separate entity from the
<a>DID controller</a>. This is the case when, for example, a parent creates
and maintains control of a <a>DID</a> for a child; a corporation creates and
maintains control of a <a>DID</a> for a subsidiary; or a manufacturer
creates and maintains control of a <a>DID</a> for a product, an IoT device,
or a digital file.
        </p>
        <p>
From a graph model perspective, the only difference from Set 1 that there is
no equivalence arc relationship between the <a>DID subject</a> and
<a>DID controller</a> nodes.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Can a DID document have multiple DID Controllers?</h2>
      <p>
Yes. A <a>DID document</a> might have more than one <a>DID controller</a>. In
this situation there are two basic options available for how control can be
shared.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Option #1: Independent Control</h3>
        <p>
In the first option, shown in the figure below, each of the <a>DID controllers</a>
might act on its own, i.e., each one has full power to update the
<a>DID document</a> independently. From a graph model perspective, in this
configuration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
Each additional <a>DID controller</a> is another distinct graph node
(which might be identified by its own <a>DID</a>).
          </li>
          <li>
The same arcs ("controls" and "controller") exist between each
<a>DID controller</a> and the <a>DID document</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <figure id="independent-did-controllers">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 75%;"
            src="diagrams/figure-c.1-independent-did-controllers.png" alt="
            Diagram showing three DID controllers each with an independent
            control relationship with the DID document
          " >
          <figcaption>
              Multiple independent <a>DID controllers</a> that can each act
              independently
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Option #2: Group Control</h3>
        <p>
In the second option, the <a>DID controllers</a> are expected to act together
in some fashion, such as when using a cryptographic algorithm that requires
multiple digital signatures ("multi-sig") or a threshold number of digital
signatures ("m-of-n"). From a functional standpoint, this option is similar
to a single <a>DID controller</a> because, although each of the
<a>DID controllers</a> in the <a>DID controller</a> group has its own graph
node, the actual control collapses into a single logical graph node
representing the <a>DID controller</a> group as shown in this figure:
        </p>
        <figure id="group-did-controllers">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 75%;"
            src="diagrams/figure-c.2-group-did-controllers.png" alt="
            Diagram showing how three DID controllers act together as a single
            DID controller group to control a DID document

          <figcaption>
Multiple <a>DID controllers</a> who are expected to act together as a
<a>DID controller</a> group
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
This configuration will often apply when the <a>DID subject</a> is an
organization, corporation, government agency, community, or other group
that is not controlled by a single individual.
