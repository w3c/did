    <p>
<a>Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A <a>DID</a> refers to any
subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)
as determined by the controller of the <a>DID</a>. In contrast to
typical, federated identifiers, <a>DIDs</a> have been designed so that they may
be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate
authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the
discovery of information related to a <a>DID</a>, the design enables the
controller of a <a>DID</a> to prove control over it without requiring permission
from any other party. <a>DIDs</a> are <a>URIs</a> that associate a <a>DID
subject</a> with a <a>DID document</a> allowing trustable interactions
associated with that subject.
    </p>
    <p>
Each <a>DID document</a> can express cryptographic material, <a>verification
methods</a>, or <a>services</a>, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a
<a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the <a>DID</a>. <a>Services</a> enable
trusted interactions associated with the <a>DID subject</a>. A <a>DID</a> might
provide the means to return the <a>DID subject</a> itself, if the <a>DID
subject</a> is an information resource such as a data model.
    </p>
    <p>
This document specifies the DID syntax, a common data model, core properties,
serialized representations, DID operations, and an explanation of the process
of resolving DIDs to the resources that they represent.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id='sotd'>

    <p>
This version of the DID Core specification, version 1.1, is experimental.
DO NOT implement it. If you want to implement DIDs, use the current version 1.0
specification: [[[DID-CORE]]].
    </p>

  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
As individuals and organizations, many of us use globally unique identifiers in
a wide variety of contexts. They serve as communications addresses (telephone
numbers, email addresses, usernames on social media), ID numbers (for passports,
drivers licenses, tax IDs, health insurance), and product identifiers (serial
numbers, barcodes, RFIDs). URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) are used for
resources on the Web and each web page you view in a browser has a globally
unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
    </p>
    <p>
The vast majority of these globally unique identifiers are not under our
control. They are issued by external authorities that decide who or what they
refer to and when they can be revoked. They are useful only in certain contexts
and recognized only by certain bodies not of our choosing. They might
disappear or cease to be valid with the failure of an organization. They might
unnecessarily reveal personal information. In many cases, they can be
fraudulently replicated and asserted by a malicious third-party, which is
more commonly known as "identity theft".
    </p>
    <p>
The Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) defined in this specification are a new
type of globally unique identifier. They are designed to enable individuals and
organizations to generate their own identifiers using systems they trust. These
new identifiers enable entities to prove control over them by authenticating
using cryptographic proofs such as digital signatures.
    </p>
    <p>
Since the generation and assertion of Decentralized Identifiers is
entity-controlled, each entity can have as many DIDs as necessary to maintain
their desired separation of identities, personas, and interactions. The use of
these identifiers can be scoped appropriately to different contexts. They
support interactions with other people, institutions, or systems that require
entities to identify themselves, or things they control, while providing control
over how much personal or private data should be revealed, all without depending
on a central authority to guarantee the continued existence of the identifier.
These ideas are explored in the DID Use Cases document [[DID-USE-CASES]].
    </p>
    <p>
This specification does not presuppose any particular technology or cryptography
to underpin the generation, persistence, resolution, or interpretation of DIDs.
For example, implementers can create Decentralized Identifiers based on
identifiers registered in federated or centralized identity management systems.
Indeed, almost all types of identifier systems can add support for DIDs. This
creates an interoperability bridge between the worlds of centralized, federated,
and decentralized identifiers. This also enables implementers to design specific
types of DIDs to work with the computing infrastructure they trust, such as
distributed ledgers, decentralized file systems, distributed databases, and
peer-to-peer networks.
    </p>
    <p>
This specification is for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
Anyone that wants to understand the core architectural principles that
are the foundation for Decentralized Identifiers;
      </li>

      <li>
Software developers that want to produce and consume Decentralized Identifiers
and their associated data formats;
      </li>
      <li>
Systems integrators that want to understand how to use Decentralized
Identifiers in their software and hardware systems;
      </li>
      <li>
Specification authors that want to create new DID infrastructures, known as DID
methods, that conform to the ecosystem described by this document.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
In addition to this specification, readers might find the
Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers [[DID-USE-CASES]]
document useful.

      <h2>A Simple Example</h2>

      <p>
A <a>DID</a> is a simple text string consisting of three parts: 1) the
<code>did</code> URI scheme identifier, 2) the identifier for the <a>DID
method</a>, and 3) the DID method-specific identifier.
      </p>

A diagram showing the parts of a DID. The left-most letters spell 'did' in blue,
are enclosed in a horizontal bracket from above and a label that reads 'scheme'
above the bracket. A gray colon follows the 'did' letters. The middle letters
spell 'example' in magenta, are enclosed in a horizontal bracket from below and
a label that reads 'DID Method' below the bracket. A gray colon follows the
DID Method. Finally, the letters at the end read '123456789abcdefghi' in
green, are enclosed in a horizontal bracket from below and a label that
reads 'DID Method Specific String' below the bracket.

DIDs and DID URLs
        </dt>
        <dd>
A Decentralized Identifier, or <a>DID</a>, is a <a>URI</a> composed of three
parts: the scheme <code>did:</code>, a method identifier, and a unique,
method-specific identifier specified by the <a>DID method</a>. <a>DIDs</a> are
resolvable to <a>DID documents</a>. A <a>DID URL</a> extends the syntax of a
basic <a>DID</a> to incorporate other standard <a>URI</a> components such as
path, query, and fragment in order to locate a particular
<a>resource</a>&mdash;for example, a cryptographic public key inside a <a>DID
document</a>, or a <a>resource</a> external to the <a>DID document</a>.
These concepts are elaborated upon in <a href="#did-syntax"></a> and <a
href="#did-url-syntax"></a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID subjects
        </dt>
        <dd>
The subject of a <a>DID</a> is, by definition, the entity identified by the
<a>DID</a>. The <a>DID subject</a> might also be the <a>DID controller</a>.
Anything can be the subject of a <a>DID</a>: person, group, organization,
thing, or concept. This is further defined in <a href="#did-subject"></a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID controllers
        </dt>
        <dd>
The <a>controller</a> of a <a>DID</a> is the entity (person, organization, or
autonomous software) that has the capability&mdash;as defined by a <a>DID
method</a>&mdash;to make changes to a <a>DID document</a>. This capability is
typically asserted by the control of a set of cryptographic keys used by
software acting on behalf of the controller, though it might also be asserted
via other mechanisms. Note that a <a>DID</a> might have more than one
controller, and the <a>DID subject</a> can be the <a>DID controller</a>, or one
of them. This concept is documented in <a href="#did-controller"></a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
Verifiable data registries
        </dt>
        <dd>
In order to be resolvable to <a>DID documents</a>, <a>DIDs</a> are typically
recorded on an underlying system or network of some kind. Regardless of the
specific technology used, any such system that supports recording <a>DIDs</a>
and returning data necessary to produce <a>DID documents</a> is called a
<a>verifiable data registry</a>. Examples include <a>distributed ledgers</a>,
decentralized file systems, databases of any kind, peer-to-peer networks, and
other forms of trusted data storage. This concept is further elaborated upon in
<a href="#methods"></a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID documents
        </dt>
        <dd>
<a>DID documents</a> contain information associated with a <a>DID</a>. They
typically express <a>verification methods</a>, such as cryptographic public
keys, and <a>services</a> relevant to interactions with the <a>DID subject</a>.
The generic properties supported in a <a>DID document</a> are specified in <a
href="#core-properties"></a>. A <a>DID document</a> can be serialized to a byte
stream (see <a href="#representations"></a>). The properties present in
a <a>DID document</a> can be updated according to the applicable operations
outlined in <a href="#methods"></a>.

This document contains examples that contain JSON and JSON-LD content.
Some of these examples contain characters that are invalid, such as inline
comments (<code>//</code>) and the use of ellipsis (<code>...</code>) to denote

remove this content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON
or JSON-LD.

Some examples contain terms, both property names and values, that are not
defined in this specification. These are indicated with a comment (<code>//

Interoperability of implementations for <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> is
tested by evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse <a>DIDs</a>
and <a>DID documents</a> that conform to this specification. Interoperability
for producers and consumers of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> is provided
by ensuring the <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> conform. Interoperability
for <a>DID method</a> specifications is provided by the details in each <a>DID

browser is not required to implement all known <a>URI</a> schemes, conformant
software that works with <a>DIDs</a> is not required to implement all known
<a>DID methods</a>. However, all implementations of a given <a>DID method</a>

In order to maximize interoperability, implementers are urged to ensure that

interpreted in the same way across non-JSON <a>representations</a>.

Additional semantics for fragment identifiers, which are compatible with and
layered upon the semantics in this section, are described for JSON-LD

        <h2>DID Parameters</h2>

        <p>
The <a>DID URL</a> syntax supports a simple format for parameters based on the
<code>query</code> component described in <a href="#query"></a>. Adding a DID
parameter to a <a>DID URL</a> means that the parameter becomes part of the
identifier for a <a>resource</a>.

          title="A DID URL with a 'versionTime' DID parameter">

          title="A DID URL with a 'service' and a 'relativeRef' DID parameter">
did:example:123?service=files&amp;relativeRef=/resume.pdf
        </pre>

        <p>
Some DID parameters are completely independent of of any specific <a>DID
method</a> and function the same way for all <a>DIDs</a>. Other DID parameters
are not supported by all <a>DID methods</a>. Where optional parameters are
supported, they are expected to operate uniformly across the <a>DID methods</a>
that do support them. The following table provides common DID parameters that
function the same way across all <a>DID methods</a>. Support for all
<a href="#did-parameters">DID Parameters</a> is OPTIONAL.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
It is generally expected that DID URL dereferencer implementations will
reference [[?DID-RESOLUTION]] for additional implementation details. The scope
of this specification only defines the contract of the most common
query parameters.

        <p>
Implementers as well as <a>DID method</a> specification authors might use
additional DID parameters that are not listed here. For maximum
interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that DID parameters use the DID
Specification Registries mechanism [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]], to avoid collision
with other uses of the same DID parameter with different semantics.
        </p>

        <p>
DID parameters might be used if there is a clear use case where the parameter
needs to be part of a <a>URL</a> that references a <a>resource</a> with more
precision than using the <a>DID</a> alone. It is expected that DID parameters
are <em>not</em> used if the same functionality can be expressed by passing
input metadata to a <a>DID resolver</a>. Additional considerations for
processing these parameters are discussed in [[?DID-RESOLUTION]].
        </p>

        <p class="note" title="DID parameters and DID resolution">
The <a>DID resolution</a> and the <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> functions can
be influenced by passing resolution options to a <a>DID resolver</a> that are
not part of the <a>DID URL</a> (see "DID Resolution Options" in [[?DID-RESOLUTION]]). This is comparable to
HTTP, where certain parameters could either be included in an HTTP URL, or
alternatively passed as HTTP headers during the dereferencing process. The
important distinction is that DID parameters that are part of the <a>DID
URL</a> should be used to specify <em>what <a>resource</a> is being
identified</em>, whereas input metadata that is not part of the <a>DID URL</a>
should be use to control <em>how that <a>resource</a> is resolved or
dereferenced</em>.

        <h2>Relative DID URLs</h2>

        <p>
A relative <a>DID URL</a> is any URL value in a <a>DID document</a> that does
not start with <code>did:&lt;method-name>:&lt;method-specific-id></code>. More
specifically, it is any URL value that does not start with the ABNF defined in
<a href="#did-syntax"></a>. The URL is expected to reference
a <a>resource</a> in the same <a>DID document</a>. Relative <a>DID URLs</a> MAY
contain relative path components, query parameters, and fragment identifiers.
        </p>

        <p>
When resolving a relative <a>DID URL</a> reference, the algorithm specified in
<a data-cite="RFC3986#section-5">RFC3986 Section 5: Reference Resolution</a>
MUST be used. The <strong>base URI</strong> value is the <a>DID</a> that is
associated with the <a>DID subject</a>, see <a href="#did-subject"></a>. The
<strong>scheme</strong> is <code>did</code>. The <strong>authority</strong> is a
combination of <code>&lt;method-name>:&lt;method-specific-id></code>, and the
<strong>path</strong>, <strong>query</strong>, and <strong>fragment</strong>
values are those defined in <a href="#path"></a>, <a href="#query"></a>, and <a
href="#fragment"></a>, respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
Relative <a>DID URLs</a> are often used to reference <a>verification methods</a>
and <a>services</a> in a <a>DID Document</a> without having to use absolute
URLs. <a>DID methods</a> where storage size is a consideration might use
relative URLs to reduce the storage size of <a>DID documents</a>.

      <h2>Extensibility</h2>
      <p>
The data model supports two types of extensibility.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
For maximum interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that extensions use the
W3C DID Specification Registries mechanism [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. The use of
this mechanism for new properties or other extensions is the only specified
mechanism that ensures that two different <a>representations</a> will be able to
work together.
        </li>
      <li>
<a>Representations</a> MAY define other extensibility mechanisms, including ones
that do not require the use of the DID Specification Registries. Such extension
mechanisms SHOULD support lossless conversion into any other conformant
<a>representation</a>. Extension mechanisms for a <a>representation</a> SHOULD
define a mapping of all properties and <a>representation</a> syntax into the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> and its type system.
      </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note" title="Unregistered extensions are less reliable">
It is always possible for two specific implementations to agree out-of-band to
use a mutually understood extension or <a>representation</a> that is not
recorded in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]];
interoperability between such implementations and the larger ecosystem will be
less reliable.

    <p>
A <a>DID</a> is associated with a <a>DID document</a>.
<a>DID documents</a> are expressed using the
<a href="#data-model">data model</a> and can be serialized into a

The following sections define the properties in a <a>DID document</a>,
including whether these properties are required or optional. These properties
describe relationships between the <a>DID subject</a> and the value of the

    <p>
The following tables contain informative references for the core properties
defined by this specification, with expected values, and whether or not they are
required. The property names in the tables are linked to the normative
definitions and more detailed descriptions of each property.

      <p>

This section describes the mechanisms by which <a>DID documents</a>
include identifiers for <a>DID subjects</a> and <a>DID controllers</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>DID Subject</h3>
        <p>
The <a>DID</a> for a particular <a>DID subject</a> is expressed using the
<code><a>id</a></code> property in the <a>DID document</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>id</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The value of <code>id</code> MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> that conforms to the rules in <a
href="#did-syntax"></a> and MUST exist in the root <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> of the <a href="#data-model">data
model</a> for the <a>DID document</a>.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <pre class="example nohighlight">
{
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghijk"
}
        </pre>

        <p>
The <code>id</code> property only denotes the <a>DID</a> of the
<a>DID subject</a> when it is present in the <em>topmost</em>
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> of the <a>DID document</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="note" title="Intermediate representations">
<a>DID method</a> specifications can create intermediate representations of a
<a>DID document</a> that do not contain the <code><a>id</a></code> property,
such as when a <a>DID resolver</a> is performing <a>DID resolution</a>.
However, the fully resolved <a>DID document</a> always contains a valid
<code><a>id</a></code> property.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>DID Controller</h3>

        <p>
A <a>DID controller</a> is an entity that is authorized to make changes to a
<a>DID document</a>. The process of authorizing a <a>DID controller</a> is
defined by the <a>DID method</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>controller</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>controller</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> or a <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">strings</a> that conform to the rules in <a
href="#did-syntax"></a>. The corresponding <a>DID document</a>(s) SHOULD
contain <a>verification relationships</a> that explicitly permit the use of
certain <a>verification methods</a> for specific purposes.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
When a <code><a>controller</a></code> property is present in a <a>DID
document</a>, its value expresses one or more <a>DIDs</a>. Any <a>verification
methods</a> contained in the <a>DID documents</a> for those <a>DIDs</a> SHOULD
be accepted as authoritative, such that proofs that satisfy those
<a>verification methods</a> are to be considered equivalent to proofs provided
by the <a>DID subject</a> and represent the <a>DID controller(s)</a> authorized to
make updates to the <a>DID document</a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"

  "controller": "did:example:bcehfew7h32f32h7af3",
}
        </pre>

        <p class="note" title="Authorization vs authentication">
Note that authorization provided by the value of <code>controller</code> is
separate from authentication as described in <a href="#authentication"></a>.
This is particularly important for key recovery in the case of cryptographic key
loss, where the <a>DID subject</a> no longer has access to their keys, or key
compromise, where the <a>DID controller</a>'s trusted third parties need to
override malicious activity by an attacker. See <a
href="#security-considerations"></a> for information related to threat models
and attack vectors.

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Also Known As</h3>

        <p>
A <a>DID subject</a> can have multiple identifiers for different purposes, or
at different times. The assertion that two or more <a>DIDs</a> (or other types
of <a>URI</a>) refer to the same <a>DID subject</a> can be made using the
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> property.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>alsoKnownAs</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>alsoKnownAs</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> where each item in the
set is a <a>URI</a> conforming to [[RFC3986]].
          </dd>
          <dd>
This relationship is a statement that the subject of this identifier is
also identified by one or more other identifiers.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <div class="note" title="Equivalence and alsoKnownAs">
          <p>
Applications might choose to consider two identifiers related by
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> to be equivalent <em>if</em> the
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> relationship is reciprocated in the reverse
direction. It is best practice <em>not</em> to consider them equivalent in the
absence of this inverse relationship. In other words, the presence of an
<code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> assertion does not prove that this assertion
is true. Therefore, it is strongly advised that a requesting party obtain
independent verification of an <code>alsoKnownAs</code> assertion.
          </p>
          <p>
Given that the <a>DID subject</a> might use different identifiers for different
purposes, an expectation of strong equivalence between the two identifiers, or
merging the information of the two corresponding <a>DID documents</a>, is not
necessarily appropriate, <em>even with</em> a reciprocal relationship.

    <section>
      <h2>Verification Methods</h2>
      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> can express <a>verification methods</a>, such as
cryptographic public keys, which can be used to <a>authenticate</a> or authorize
interactions with the <a>DID subject</a> or associated parties. For example, a
cryptographic public key can be used as a <a>verification method</a> with
respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it verifies that the signer
could use the associated cryptographic private key. <a>Verification methods</a>
might take many parameters. An example of this is a set of five cryptographic
keys from which any three are required to contribute to a cryptographic
threshold signature.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>verificationMethod</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
The <code>verificationMethod</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value
MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of <a>verification
methods</a>, where each <a>verification method</a> is expressed using a <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>. The <a>verification method</a> <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST include the <code>id</code>,
<code>type</code>, <code>controller</code>, and specific verification material
properties that are determined by the value of <code>type</code> and are defined
in <a href="#verification-material"></a>. A <a>verification method</a> MAY
include additional properties. <a>Verification methods</a> SHOULD be registered
in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
          </p>

          <dl>
            <dt id="prop-verificationMethod-id">id</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
The value of the <code><a>id</a></code> property for a <a>verification

The semantics of the <code>controller</code> property are the same when the
subject of the relationship is the <a>DID document</a> as when the subject of
the relationship is a <a>verification method</a>, such as a cryptographic public
key. Since a key can't control itself, and the key controller cannot be inferred
from the <a>DID document</a>, it is necessary to explicitly express the identity
of the controller of the key. The difference is that the value of
<code>controller</code> for a <a>verification method</a> is <em>not</em>
necessarily a <a>DID controller</a>. <a>DID controllers</a> are expressed
using the <code><a>controller</a></code> property at the highest level of the
<a>DID document</a> (the topmost <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> in the
<a href="#data-model">data model</a>); see <a href="#did-controller"></a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Verification Material</h3>

        <p>
Verification material is any information that is used by a process that applies
a <a>verification method</a>. The <code>type</code> of a <a>verification
method</a> is expected to be used to determine its compatibility with such
processes. Examples of verification material properties are
<code><a>publicKeyJwk</a></code> or <code><a>publicKeyMultibase</a></code>. A
<a>cryptographic suite</a> specification is responsible for specifying the
<a>verification method</a> <code>type</code> and its associated verification
material. For example, see
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">JSON
Web Signature 2020</a> and <a
href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-ed25519-2020/">Ed25519 Signature 2020</a>.
For all registered <a>verification method</a> types and associated verification
material available for <a>DIDs</a>, please see the DID Specification Registries
[[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
        </p>

        <p>
To increase the likelihood of interoperable implementations, this specification
limits the number of formats for expressing verification material in a <a>DID
document</a>. The fewer formats that implementers have to
implement, the more likely it will be that they will support all of them. This
approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between ease of implementation
and supporting formats that have historically had broad deployment.
Two supported verification material properties are listed below:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>publicKeyJwk</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
The <code>publicKeyJwk</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> representing a JSON Web Key that
conforms to [[RFC7517]]. The <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST NOT
contain "d", or any other members of the private information class as described
in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-8.1.1">Registration
Template</a>. It is RECOMMENDED that verification methods that use JWKs
[[RFC7517]] to represent their public keys use the value of <code>kid</code> as
their <a href="#fragment">fragment identifier</a>. It is RECOMMENDED that JWK
<code>kid</code> values are set to the public key fingerprint [[RFC7638]]. See
the first key in <a href="#example-various-verification-method-types"></a> for
an example of a public key with a compound key identifier.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>publicKeyMultibase</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
The <code>publicKeyMultibase</code> property is OPTIONAL. This feature is
non-normative. If present, the value MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> representation of a [[?MULTIBASE]] encoded
public key.
            </p>
            <p class="advisement">
Note that the [[?MULTIBASE]] specification is not yet a standard and is
subject to change. There might be some use cases for this data format
where <code><b>public</b>KeyMultibase</code> is defined, to allow for
expression of public keys, but <code><b>private</b>KeyMultibase</code>
is not defined, to protect against accidental leakage of secret keys.
            </p>
          </dd>
      </dl>

        <p>
A <a>verification method</a> MUST NOT contain multiple verification material
properties for the same material. For example, expressing key material in a
<a>verification method</a> using both <code>publicKeyJwk</code> and
<code>publicKeyMultibase</code> at the same time is prohibited.
        </p>

        <p>
An example of a <a>DID document</a> containing <a>verification methods</a> using
both properties above is shown below.

        <h3>Referring to Verification Methods</h3>
        <p>
<a>Verification methods</a> can be embedded in or referenced from properties
associated with various <a>verification relationships</a> as described in <a
href="#verification-relationships"></a>. Referencing <a>verification methods</a>
allows them to be used by more than one <a>verification relationship</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
If the value of a <a>verification method</a> property is a <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>, the <a>verification method</a> has been
embedded and its properties can be accessed directly. However, if the value is a
URL <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>, the <a>verification method</a> has
been included by reference and its properties will need to be retrieved from
elsewhere in the <a>DID document</a> or from another <a>DID document</a>. This
is done by dereferencing the URL and searching the resulting <a>resource</a> for a
<a>verification method</a> <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> with an
<code>id</code> property whose value matches the URL.

      <h2>Verification Relationships</h2>

      <p>
A <a>verification relationship</a> expresses the relationship between the <a>DID
subject</a> and a <a>verification method</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
Different <a>verification relationships</a> enable the associated
<a>verification methods</a> to be used for different purposes. It is up to a
<em>verifier</em> to ascertain the validity of a verification attempt by
checking that the <a>verification method</a> used is contained in the
appropriate <a>verification relationship</a> property of the
<a>DID Document</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
The <a>verification relationship</a> between the <a>DID subject</a> and the
<a>verification method</a> is explicit in the <a>DID document</a>.
<a>Verification methods</a> that are not associated with a particular
<a>verification relationship</a> cannot be used for that <a>verification
relationship</a>. For example, a <a>verification method</a> in the value of
the <code><a>authentication</a></code> property cannot be used to engage in
key agreement protocols with the <a>DID subject</a>&mdash;the value of the
<code><a>keyAgreement</a></code> property needs to be used for that.
      </p>
      <p>
The <a>DID document</a> does not express revoked keys using a <a>verification
relationship</a>. If a referenced verification method is not in the latest
<a>DID Document</a> used to dereference it, then that verification method is
considered invalid or revoked. Each <a>DID method</a> specification is expected
to detail how revocation is performed and tracked.
      </p>
      <p>
The following sections define several useful <a>verification relationships</a>.
A <a>DID document</a> MAY include any of these, or other properties, to
express a specific <a>verification relationship</a>. In order to maximize global
interoperability, any such properties used SHOULD be registered in the DID
Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Authentication</h2>

        <p>
The <code>authentication</code> <a>verification relationship</a> is used to
specify how the <a>DID subject</a> is expected to be <a>authenticated</a>, for
purposes such as logging into a website or engaging in any sort of
challenge-response protocol.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>authentication</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>authentication</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated
value MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of one or more
<a>verification methods</a>. Each <a>verification method</a> MAY be embedded or
referenced.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Authentication property

    }
  ],
  <span class="comment">...</span>
}
        </pre>

        <p>
If authentication is established, it is up to the <a>DID method</a> or other
application to decide what to do with that information. A particular <a>DID
method</a> could decide that authenticating as a <a>DID controller</a> is
sufficient to, for example, update or delete the <a>DID document</a>. Another
<a>DID method</a> could require different keys, or a different <a>verification
method</a> entirely, to be presented in order to update or delete the <a>DID
document</a> than that used to <a>authenticate</a>. In other words, what is done
<em>after</em> the authentication check is out of scope for the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a>; <a>DID methods</a> and applications are
expected to define this themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
This is useful to any <em>authentication verifier</em> that needs to check to
see if an entity that is attempting to <a>authenticate</a> is, in fact,
presenting a valid proof of authentication. When a <em>verifier</em> receives
some data (in some protocol-specific format) that contains a proof that was made
for the purpose of "authentication", and that says that an entity is identified
by the <a>DID</a>, then that <em>verifier</em> checks to ensure that the proof
can be verified using a <a>verification method</a> (e.g., public key) listed
under <code><a>authentication</a></code> in the <a>DID Document</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
Note that the <a>verification method</a> indicated by the
<code><a>authentication</a></code> property of a <a>DID document</a> can only be
used to <a>authenticate</a> the <a>DID subject</a>. To <a>authenticate</a> a
different <a>DID controller</a>, the entity associated with the value of
<code>controller</code>, as defined in <a href="#did-controller"></a>, needs to
<a>authenticate</a> with its <em>own</em> <a>DID document</a> and associated
<code><a>authentication</a></code> <a>verification relationship</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Assertion</h2>

        <p>
The <code>assertionMethod</code> <a>verification relationship</a> is used to
specify how the <a>DID subject</a> is expected to express claims, such as for
the purposes of issuing a Verifiable Credential [[?VC-DATA-MODEL]].
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>assertionMethod</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>assertionMethod</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the
associated value MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of
one or more <a>verification methods</a>. Each <a>verification method</a> MAY be
embedded or referenced.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
This property is useful, for example, during the processing of a <a>verifiable
credential</a> by a verifier. During verification, a verifier checks to see if a
<a>verifiable credential</a> contains a proof created by the <a>DID subject</a>
by checking that the <a>verification method</a> used to assert the proof is
associated with the <code><a>assertionMethod</a></code> property in the
corresponding <a>DID document</a>.

      <section>
        <h2>Key Agreement</h2>

        <p>
The <code>keyAgreement</code> <a>verification relationship</a> is used to
specify how an entity can generate encryption material in order to transmit
confidential information intended for the <a>DID subject</a>, such as for
the purposes of establishing a secure communication channel with the recipient.
        </p>

        <dl>

          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when encrypting a message intended

decryption key for the recipient.

        <h2>Capability Invocation</h2>

        <p>
The <code>capabilityInvocation</code> <a>verification relationship</a> is used
to specify a <a>verification method</a> that might be used by the <a>DID
subject</a> to invoke a cryptographic capability, such as the authorization to
update the <a>DID Document</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>capabilityInvocation</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>capabilityInvocation</code> property is OPTIONAL. If present, the
associated value MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of
one or more <a>verification methods</a>. Each <a>verification method</a> MAY be
embedded or referenced.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when a <a>DID subject</a> needs to
access a protected HTTP API that requires authorization in order to use it. In
order to authorize when using the HTTP API, the <a>DID subject</a>
uses a capability that is associated with a particular URL that is
exposed via the HTTP API. The invocation of the capability could be
expressed in a number of ways, e.g., as a digitally signed
message that is placed into the HTTP Headers.
        </p>
        <p>
The server providing the HTTP API is the <em>verifier</em> of the capability and
it would need to verify that the <a>verification method</a> referred to by the
invoked capability exists in the <code><a>capabilityInvocation</a></code>
property of the <a>DID document</a>. The verifier would also check to make sure
that the action being performed is valid and the capability is appropriate for
the resource being accessed. If the verification is successful, the server has
cryptographically determined that the invoker is authorized to access the
protected resource.

        <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when a <a>DID controller</a>
chooses to delegate their capability to access a protected HTTP API to a party
other than themselves. In order to delegate the capability, the <a>DID
subject</a> would use a <a>verification method</a> associated with the
<code>capabilityDelegation</code> <a>verification relationship</a> to
cryptographically sign the capability over to another <a>DID subject</a>. The
delegate would then use the capability in a manner that is similar to the
example described in <a href="#capability-invocation"></a>.

      <h2>Services</h2>

      <p>
<a>Services</a> are used in <a>DID documents</a> to express ways of
communicating with the <a>DID subject</a> or associated entities. A
<a>service</a> can be any type of service the <a>DID subject</a> wants to
advertise, including <a>decentralized identity management</a> services for
further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
Due to privacy concerns, revealing public information through <a>services</a>,
such as social media accounts, personal websites, and email addresses, is
discouraged. Further exploration of privacy concerns can be found in <a

information associated with <a>services</a> is often service specific. For
example, the information associated with an encrypted messaging service can
express how to initiate the encrypted link before messaging begins.

    <h1>Representations</h1>

    <p>
A concrete serialization of a <a>DID document</a> in this specification is
called a <a>representation</a>. A <a>representation</a> is created by
serializing the <a href="#data-model">data model</a> through a process called
<dfn>production</dfn>. A <a>representation</a> is transformed into the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> through a process called
<dfn>consumption</dfn>. The <em>production</em> and <em>consumption</em>
processes enable the conversion of information from one <a>representation</a> to
another. This specification defines <a>representations</a> for JSON and JSON-LD,
and developers can use any other <a>representation</a>, such as XML or
YAML, that is capable of expressing the <a href="#data-model">data model</a>.
The following sections define the general rules for <a>production</a> and
<a>consumption</a>, as well as the JSON and JSON-LD <a>representations</a>.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Production and Consumption</h2>

      <p>
In addition to the <a>representations</a> defined in this specification,
implementers can use other <a>representations</a>, providing each such
<a>representation</a> is properly specified (including rules for
interoperable handling of properties not listed in the DID Specification
Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]). See <a href="#extensibility"></a>
for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
The requirements for all <a>representations</a> are as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>representation</a> MUST define deterministic production and consumption
rules for all data types specified in <a href="#data-model"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>representation</a> MUST be uniquely associated with an IANA-registered
Media Type.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>representation</a> MUST define fragment processing rules for its Media
Type that are conformant with the fragment processing rules defined in
<a href="#fragment"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>representation</a> SHOULD use the lexical representation of <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> data types. For example, JSON and JSON-LD use
the XML Schema <code>dateTime</code> lexical serialization to represent
<a>datetimes</a>. A <a>representation</a> MAY choose to serialize the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> data types using a different lexical
serializations as long as the <a>consumption</a> process back into the <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> is lossless. For example, some CBOR-based
<a>representations</a> express <a>datetime</a> values using integers to
represent the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>representation</a> MAY define <a>representation-specific entries</a> that
are stored in a <a>representation-specific entries</a>
<a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>
for use during the <a>production</a> and <a>consumption</a> process. These
entries are used when consuming or producing to aid in ensuring lossless
conversion.
        </li>
        <li>
In order to maximize interoperability, <a>representation</a> specification
authors SHOULD register their <a>representation</a> in the DID Specification
Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
The requirements for all <a>conforming producers</a> are as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>conforming producer</a> MUST take a <a>DID document</a> <a
href="#data-model">data model</a> and a <a>representation-specific entries</a>
<a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a> as input into the <a>production</a> process.
The <a>conforming producer</a> MAY accept additional options as input
into the <a>production</a> process.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>conforming producer</a> MUST serialize all entries in the <a>DID
document</a> <a href="#data-model">data model</a>, and the
<a>representation-specific entries</a> <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>,
that do not
have explicit processing rules for the <a>representation</a> being produced
using only the <a>representation</a>'s data type processing rules and
return the serialization after the <a>production</a> process completes.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>conforming producer</a> MUST return the Media Type <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> associated with the <a>representation</a>
after the <a>production</a> process completes.
        </li>
        <li>
A conforming producer MUST NOT produce non-conforming <a>DIDs</a> or <a>DID
documents</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
The requirements for all <a>conforming consumers</a> are as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>conforming consumer</a> MUST take a <a>representation</a> and
Media Type <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> as input into
the <a>consumption</a> process. A <a>conforming consumer</a> MAY accept
additional options as input into the <a>consumption</a> process.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>conforming consumer</a> MUST determine the <a>representation</a> of a
<a>DID document</a> using the Media Type input <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>conforming consumer</a> MUST detect any <a>representation-specific
entry</a> across all known <a>representations</a> and place the entry into a
<a>representation-specific entries</a> <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>
which is returned after the <a>consumption</a> process completes. A list of
all known <a>representation-specific entries</a> is available in the
DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>conforming consumer</a> MUST add all <a>non-representation-specific
entries</a>
that do not have explicit processing rules for the <a>representation</a> being
consumed to the <a>DID document</a> <a href="#data-model">data model</a> using
only the <a>representation</a>'s data type processing rules and return the
<a>DID document</a> data model after the <a>consumption</a> process completes.
        </li>
        <li>
A conforming consumer MUST produce errors when consuming non-conforming
<a>DIDs</a> or <a>DID documents</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <h1>Methods</h1>

    <p>
A <a>DID method</a> defines how implementers can realize the features
described by this specification. <a>DID methods</a> are often associated with a
particular <a>verifiable data registry</a>. New <a>DID methods</a> are defined
in their own specifications to enable interoperability between different
implementations of the same <a>DID method</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
Conceptually, the relationship between this specification and a <a>DID
method</a> specification is similar to the relationship between the IETF generic
<a>URI</a> specification [[?RFC3986]] and a specific <a>URI</a> scheme
[[?IANA-URI-SCHEMES]], such as the <code>http</code> scheme [[?RFC7230]]. In
addition to defining a specific <a>DID scheme</a>, a <a>DID method</a>
specification also defines the mechanisms for creating, resolving, updating, and
deactivating <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> using a specific type of
<a>verifiable data registry</a>. It also documents all implementation
considerations related to <a>DIDs</a> as well as Security and Privacy
Considerations.
    </p>

    <p>
This section specifies the requirements for authoring <a>DID method</a>
specifications.
    </p>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2>Method Syntax</h2>

      <p>
The requirements for all <a>DID method</a> specifications when defining the
method-specific DID Syntax are as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST define exactly one method-specific <a>DID
scheme</a> that is identified by exactly one method name as specified by the
<code>method-name</code> rule in <a href="#did-syntax"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how to generate the
<code>method-specific-id</code> component of a <a>DID</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST define sensitivity and normalization of
the value of the <code>method-specific-id</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
The <code>method-specific-id</code> value MUST be unique within a <a>DID
method</a>. The <code>method-specific-id</code> value itself might be globally
unique.
        </li>
        <li>
Any <a>DID</a> generated by a <a>DID method</a> MUST be globally unique.
        </li>
        <li>
To reduce the chances of <code>method-name</code> conflicts, a <a>DID method</a>
specification SHOULD be registered in the DID Specification Registries
[[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> MAY define multiple <code>method-specific-id</code> formats.
        </li>
        <li>
The <code>method-specific-id</code> format MAY include colons. The use of
colons MUST comply syntactically with the <code>method-specific-id</code> ABNF
rule.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID paths</a>
that are more restrictive than the generic rules in <a href="#path"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID queries</a>
that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID
fragments</a> that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="note" title="Colons in method-specific-id">
The meaning of colons in the <code>method-specific-id</code> is entirely
method-specific. Colons might be used by <a>DID methods</a> for establishing
hierarchically partitioned namespaces, for identifying specific instances or
parts of the <a>verifiable data registry</a>, or for other purposes.
Implementers are advised to avoid assuming any meanings or
behaviors associated with a colon that are generically applicable to all
<a>DID methods</a>.

      <h2>Method Operations</h2>

      <p>
The requirements for all <a>DID method</a> specifications when defining the
method operations are as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST define how authorization is performed to
execute all operations, including any necessary cryptographic processes.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a <a>DID controller</a>
creates a <a>DID</a> and its associated <a>DID document</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a <a>DID resolver</a> uses a
<a>DID</a> to resolve a <a>DID document</a>, including how the <a>DID
resolver</a> can verify the authenticity of the response.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify what constitutes an update to a
<a>DID document</a> and how a <a>DID controller</a> can update a <a>DID
document</a> <em>or</em> state that updates are not possible.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a <a>DID controller</a> can
deactivate a <a>DID</a> <em>or</em> state that deactivation is not possible.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
The authority of a party that is performing authorization to carry out the
operations is specific to a <a>DID method</a>. For example, a <a>DID method</a>
might &mdash;
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
make use of the <code><a>controller</a></code> property.
        </li>
        <li>
use the <a>verification methods</a> listed under
<code><a>authentication</a></code>.
        </li>
        <li>
use other constructs in the <a>DID Document</a> such as the <a>verification
method</a> specified via the <code><a>capabilityInvocation</a></code>
<a>verification relationship</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
not use the <a>DID document</a> for this decision at all, and depend on an
out-of-band mechanism, instead.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security Requirements</h2>

      <p>
The requirements for all <a>DID method</a> specifications when authoring the
<em>Security Considerations</em> section are as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>DID method</a> specifications MUST follow all guidelines and normative
language provided in <a data-cite="RFC3552#section-5">RFC3552: Writing Security
Considerations Sections</a> for the <a>DID</a> operations defined in the <a>DID
method</a> specification.
        </li>
        <li>
The Security Considerations section MUST document the following forms of attack
for the <a>DID</a> operations defined in the <a>DID method</a> specification:
eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, denial of
service, <a>amplification</a>, and man-in-the-middle. Other known
forms of attack SHOULD also be documented.
        </li>
        <li>
The Security Considerations section MUST discuss residual risks, such as the
risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation, or cipher
after threat mitigation was deployed.
        </li>
        <li>
The Security Considerations section MUST provide integrity protection and update
authentication for all operations required by Section <a
href="#method-operations"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
If authentication is involved, particularly user-host authentication, the
security characteristics of the authentication method MUST be clearly
documented.
        </li>
        <li>
The Security Considerations section MUST discuss the policy mechanism by which
<a>DIDs</a> are proven to be uniquely assigned.
        </li>
        <li>
Method-specific endpoint authentication MUST be discussed. Where <a>DID
methods</a> make use of <a>DLTs</a> with varying network topology, sometimes
offered as <em>light node</em> or <em>
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security">thin client</a></em>
implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security assumptions
of the topology available to implementations of the <a>DID method</a> MUST be
discussed.
        </li>
        <li>
If a protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, the <a>DID
method</a> specification MUST clearly indicate which portions of the data are
protected and by what protections, and it SHOULD give an indication of the
sorts of attacks to which the cryptographic protection is susceptible. Some
examples are integrity only, confidentiality, and endpoint authentication.
        </li>
        <li>
Data which is to be held secret (keying material, random seeds, and so on)
SHOULD be clearly labeled.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>DID method</a> specifications SHOULD explain and specify the implementation
of signatures on <a>DID documents</a>, if applicable.
        </li>
        <li>
Where <a>DID methods</a> use peer-to-peer computing resources, such as with all
known <a>DLTs</a>, the expected burdens of those resources SHOULD be discussed
in relation to denial of service.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>DID methods</a> that introduce new authentication <a>service</a>
types, as described in <a href="#services"></a>, SHOULD consider the
security requirements of the supported authentication protocol.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Privacy Requirements</h2>

The requirements for all <a>DID method</a> specifications when authoring the
<em>Privacy Considerations</em> section are:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
The <a>DID method</a> specification's Privacy Considerations section MUST
discuss any subsection of Section 5 of [[?RFC6973]] that could apply in a
method-specific manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored
data compromise, unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation,
identification, secondary use, disclosure, and exclusion.

    <h1>Security Considerations</h1>

    <p>
This section contains a variety of security considerations that people using
Decentralized Identifiers are advised to consider before deploying this
technology in a production setting. <a>DIDs</a> are designed to operate under
the threat model used by many IETF standards and documented
in [[?RFC3552]]. This section elaborates upon a number of the considerations
in [[?RFC3552]], as well as other considerations that are unique to <a>DID</a>

      <h2>Choosing DID Resolvers</h2>

      <p>
The DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]] contains an
informative list of <a>DID method</a> names and their corresponding <a>DID
method</a> specifications. Implementers need to bear in mind that there is no
central authority to mandate which <a>DID method</a> specification is to be used
with any specific <a>DID method</a> name. If there is doubt on whether or not a
specific <a>DID resolver</a> implements a <a>DID method</a> correctly, the DID
Specification Registries can be used to look up the registered specification
and make an informed decision regarding which <a>DID resolver</a>
implementation to use.

      <h2>Proving Control and Binding</h2>

      <p>
Binding an entity in the digital world or the physical world to a <a>DID</a>, to
a <a>DID document</a>, or to cryptographic material requires, the use of
security protocols contemplated by this specification. The following sections
describe some possible scenarios and how an entity therein might prove control
over a <a>DID</a> or a <a>DID document</a> for the purposes of authentication or
authorization.
      </p>

      <section class="notoc">
        <h3>Proving Control of a DID and/or DID Document</h3>

        <p>
Proving control over a <a>DID</a> and/or a <a>DID Document</a> is useful when
updating either in a <a>verifiable data registry</a> or authenticating with
remote systems. Cryptographic digital signatures and <a>verifiable
timestamps</a> enable certain security protocols related to <a>DID documents</a>
to be cryptographically verifiable. For these purposes, this specification
defines useful <a>verification relationships</a> in <a
href="#authentication"></a> and <a href="#capability-invocation"></a>. The
secret cryptographic material associated with the <a>verification methods</a>
can be used to generate a cryptographic digital signature as a part of an
authentication or authorization security protocol.
        </p>

        <p class="note" title="Signed DID documents">
Some <a>DID methods</a> allow digital signatures and other proofs to be
included in the <a>DID document</a> or a metadata structure.
However, such proofs by themselves do not necessarily prove control over a
<a>DID</a>, or guarantee that the <a>DID document</a> is the correct one for
the <a>DID</a>. In order to obtain
the correct <a>DID document</a> and verify control over a <a>DID</a>, it is
necessary to perform the <a>DID resolution</a> process as defined by the
<a>DID method</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="notoc">
        <h3>Binding to Physical Identity</h3>

        <p>
A <a>DID</a> and <a>DID document</a> do not inherently carry any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">personal data</a> and
it is strongly advised that non-public entities do not publish personal data in
<a>DID documents</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
It can be useful to express a binding of a <a>DID</a> to a person's or
organization's physical identity in a way that is provably asserted by a
trusted authority, such as a government. This specification provides
the <a href="#assertion"></a> <a>verification relationship</a> for these
purposes. This feature can enable interactions that are private and can be
considered legally enforceable under one or more jurisdictions; establishing
such bindings has to be carefully balanced against privacy considerations (see
<a href="#privacy-considerations"></a>).
        </p>

        <p>
The process of binding a <a>DID</a> to something in the physical world, such as
a person or an organization &mdash; for example, by using <a>verifiable
credentials</a> with the same subject as that <a>DID</a> &mdash; is contemplated
by this specification and further defined in the Verifiable Credentials Data
Model [[VC-DATA-MODEL]].

      <h2>Authentication Service Endpoints</h2>

      <p>
If a <a>DID document</a> publishes a <a>service</a> intended for
authentication or authorization of the <a>DID subject</a> (see Section <a
href="#services"></a>), it is the responsibility of the <a>service
endpoint</a> provider, subject, or requesting party to comply with the
requirements of the authentication protocols supported at that <a>service
endpoint</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Non-Repudiation</h2>

      <p>
Non-repudiation of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID document</a> updates is supported if:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
The <a>verifiable data registry</a> supports
<a>verifiable timestamps</a>. See "DID Document Metadata" in [[?DID-RESOLUTION]]
for further information on useful timestamps that can be used during the
<a>DID resolution</a> process.
        </li>
        <li>
The subject is monitoring for unauthorized updates as elaborated upon in
<a href="#notification-of-did-document-changes"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
The subject has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious updates according
to the authorization mechanism for the <a>DID method</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Notification of DID Document Changes</h2>

      <p>
One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a <a>DID document</a> is
monitoring and actively notifying the <a>DID subject</a> when there are changes.
This is analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to the email
addresses on file.
      </p>
      <p>
In the case of a <a>DID</a>, there is no intermediary registrar or account
provider to generate such notifications. However, if the <a>verifiable data
registry</a> on which the <a>DID</a> is registered directly supports change
notifications, a subscription service can be offered to <a>DID controllers</a>.
Notifications could be sent directly to the relevant <a>service endpoints</a>
listed in an existing <a>DID</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
If a <a>DID controller</a> chooses to rely on a third-party monitoring service
(other than the <a>verifiable data registry</a> itself), this introduces another
vector of attack.
      </p>

      <h2>Key and Signature Expiration</h2>

      <p>
In a <a>decentralized identifier</a> architecture, there might not be
centralized authorities to enforce cryptographic material or cryptographic
digital signature expiration policies. Therefore, it is with supporting software
such as <a>DID resolvers</a> and verification libraries that requesting parties
validate that cryptographic material were not expired at the time they were
used. Requesting parties might employ their own expiration policies in addition
to inputs into their verification processes. For example, some requesting
parties might accept authentications from five minutes in the past, while others
with access to high precision time sources might require authentications to be
time stamped within the last 500 milliseconds.
      </p>
      <p>
There are some requesting parties that have legitimate needs to extend the use
of already-expired cryptographic material, such as verifying legacy
cryptographic digital signatures. In these scenarios, a requesting party might
instruct their verification software to ignore cryptographic key material
expiration or determine if the cryptographic key material was expired at the
time it was used.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Verification Method Rotation</h2>

      <p>
Rotation is a management process that enables the secret cryptographic material
associated with an existing <a>verification method</a> to be deactivated or
destroyed once a new <a>verification method</a> has been added to the  <a>DID
document</a>. Going forward, any new proofs that a <a>controller</a> would have
generated using the old secret cryptographic material can now instead be
generated using the new  cryptographic material and can be verified using the
new <a>verification method</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
Rotation is a useful mechanism for protecting against verification method
compromise, since frequent rotation of a verification method by the controller
reduces the value of a single compromised verification method to an attacker.
Performing revocation immediately after rotation is useful for verification
methods that a controller designates for short-lived verifications, such as
those involved in encrypting messages and authentication.
      </p>

      <p>
The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of
<a>verification method</a> rotation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
<a>Verification method</a> rotation is a proactive security measure.
        </li>
        <li>
It is generally considered a best practice to perform <a>verification method</a>
rotation on a regular basis.
        </li>
        <li>
Higher security environments tend to employ more frequent verification method
rotation.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Verification method</a> rotation manifests only as changes to the current or
latest version of a <a>DID document</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
When a <a>verification method</a> has been active for a long time, or used for
many operations, a controller might wish to perform a rotation.
        </li>
        <li>
Frequent rotation of a <a>verification method</a> might be frustrating for
parties that are forced to continuously renew or refresh associated credentials.
        </li>
        <li>
Proofs or signatures that rely on <a>verification methods</a> that are not
present in the latest version of a <a>DID document</a> are not impacted by
rotation. In these cases, verification software might require additional
information, such as when a particular <a>verification method</a> was
expected to be valid as well as access to a <a>verifiable data registry</a>
containing a historical record, to determine the validity of the proof or
signature. This option might not be available in all <a>DID methods</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
The section on <a href="#method-operations">DID method operations</a> specifies
the <a>DID</a> operations to be supported by a <a>DID method</a> specification,
including <a href="#method-operations">update</a> which is expected to be used
to perform a <a>verification method</a> rotation.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>controller</a> performs a rotation when they add a new <a>verification
method</a> that is meant to replace an existing <a>verification method</a> after
some time.
        </li>
        <li>
Not all <a>DID methods</a> support <a>verification method</a> rotation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Verification Method Revocation</h2>

      <p>
Revocation is a management process that enables the secret cryptographic
material associated with an existing <a>verification method</a> to be
deactivated such that it ceases to be a valid form of creating new
proofs of digital signatures.
      </p>
      <p>
Revocation is a useful mechanism for reacting to a verification method
compromise. Performing revocation immediately after rotation is useful for
verification methods that a controller designates for short-lived verifications,
such as those involved in encrypting messages and authentication.
      </p>

      <p>
Compromise of the secrets associated with a <a>verification method</a> allows
the attacker to use them according to the <a>verification relationship</a>
expressed by <a>controller</a> in the <a>DID document</a>, for example, for
authentication. The attacker's use of the secrets might be indistinguishable
from the legitimate <a href="#did-controller">controller's</a> use starting from
the time the <a>verification method</a> was registered, to the time it was
revoked.
      </p>


      <p>
The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of
<a>verification method</a> revocation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
<a>Verification method</a> revocation is a reactive security measure.
        </li>

        <li>
It is considered a best practice to support key revocation.
        </li>

        <li>
A <a>controller</a> is expected to immediately revoke any <a>verification
method</a> that is known to be compromised.
        </li>

        <li>
<a>Verification method</a> revocation can only be embodied in changes to
the latest version of a <a>DID Document</a>; it cannot retroactively adjust
previous versions.
        </li>

        <li>
As described in <a href="#verification-material"></a>, absence of a verification
method is the only form of revocation that applies to all <a>DID Methods</a>
that support revocation.
        </li>

        <li>
If a <a>verification method</a> is no longer exclusively accessible to the
<a>controller</a> or parties trusted to act on behalf of the <a>controller</a>,
it is expected to be revoked immediately to reduce the risk of
compromises such as masquerading, theft, and fraud.
        </li>

        <li>
Revocation is expected to be understood as a <a>controller</a> expressing that
proofs or signatures associated with a revoked <a>verification method</a>
created after its revocation should be treated as invalid. It could also imply a
concern that existing proofs or signatures might have been created by an
attacker, but this is not necessarily the case. Verifiers, however, might still
choose to accept or reject any such proofs or signatures at their own
discretion.
        </li>

        <li>
The section on <a href="#method-operations">DID method operations</a> specifies
the <a>DID</a> operations to be supported by a <a>DID method</a> specification,
including <a href="#method-operations">update</a> and <a
href="#method-operations">deactivate</a>, which might be used to remove
a <a>verification method</a> from a <a>DID document</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
Not all <a>DID methods</a> support <a>verification method</a> revocation.
        </li>

        <li>
Even if a <a>verification method</a> is present in a <a>DID document</a>,
additional information, such as a public key revocation certificate, or an
external allow or deny list, could be used to determine whether a
<a>verification method</a> has been revoked.
        </li>

        <li>
The day-to-day operation of any software relying on a compromised
<a>verification method</a>, such as an individual's operating system, antivirus,
or endpoint protection software, could be impacted when the <a>verification
method</a> is publicly revoked.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <section class="notoc">
        <h3>Revocation Semantics</h3>

        <p>
Although verifiers might choose not to accept proofs or signatures from a
revoked verification method, knowing whether a verification was made with a
revoked <a>verification method</a> is trickier than it might seem. Some <a>DID
methods</a> provide the ability to look back at the state of a <a>DID</a> at a
point in time, or at a particular version of the <a>DID document</a>. When such
a feature is combined with a reliable way to determine the time or <a>DID</a>
version that existed when a cryptographically verifiable statement was made,
then revocation does not undo that statement. This can be the basis for using
<a>DIDs</a> to make binding commitments; for example, to sign a mortgage.
        </p>
        <p>
If these conditions are met, revocation is not retroactive; it only nullifies
future use of the method.
        </p>
        <p>
However, in order for such semantics to be safe, the second condition &mdash; an
ability to know what the state of the <a>DID document</a> was at the time the
assertion was made &mdash; is expected to apply. Without that guarantee, someone
could discover a revoked key and use it to make cryptographically verifiable
statements with a simulated date in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
Some <a>DID methods</a> only allow the retrieval of the current state of a
<a>DID</a>. When this is true, or when the state of a <a>DID</a> at the time of
a cryptographically verifiable statement cannot be reliably determined, then the
only safe course is to disallow any consideration of DID state with respect to
time, except the present moment. <a>DID</a> ecosystems that take this approach
essentially provide cryptographically verifiable statements as ephemeral tokens
that can be invalidated at any time by the <a>DID controller</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="notoc">
        <h3>Revocation in Trustless Systems</h3>

        <p>
Trustless systems are those where all trust is derived from cryptographically
provable assertions, and more specifically, where no metadata outside of the
cryptographic system is factored into the determination of trust in the system.
To verify a signature of proof for a <a>verification method</a> which has been
revoked in a trustless system, a <a>DID method</a> needs to support either or
both of the `versionId` or `versionTime`, as well as both the `updated` and
`nextUpdate`, <a>DID document</a> metadata properties. A verifier can validate a
signature or proof of a revoked key if and only if all of the following are
true:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
The proof or signature includes the `versionId` or `versionTime` of the <a>DID
document</a> that was used at the point the signature or proof was created.
          </li>
          <li>
The verifier can determine the point in time at which the signature or proof was
made; for example, it was anchored on a blockchain.
          </li>
          <li>
For the resolved <a>DID document</a> metadata, the `updated` timestamp is
before, and the `nextUpdate` timestamp is after, the point in time at which the
signature or proof was made.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
In systems that are willing to admit metadata other than those constituting
cryptographic input, similar trust may be achieved -- but always on the
same basis where a careful judgment is made about whether a
<a>DID document</a>'s content at the moment of a signing event
contained the expected content.

      <h2>DID Recovery</h2>

      <p>
Recovery is a reactive security measure whereby a <a>controller</a> that has
lost the ability to perform DID operations, such as through the loss of a
device, is able to regain the ability to perform DID operations.
      </p>

      <p>
The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of
<a>DID</a> recovery:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>
Performing recovery proactively on an infrequent but regular basis, can help to
ensure that control has not been lost.
        </li>

        <li>
It is considered a best practice to never reuse cryptographic material
associated with recovery for any other purposes.
        </li>

        <li>
Recovery is commonly performed in conjunction with <a
href="#verification-method-rotation">verification method rotation</a> and <a
href="#verification-method-revocation">verification method revocation</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
Recovery is advised when a <a>controller</a> or services trusted to act on their
behalf no longer have the exclusive ability to perform DID operations as
described in <a href="#method-operations"></a>.
        </li>

        <li>
<a>DID method</a> specifications might choose to enable support for a quorum of
trusted parties to facilitate recovery. Some of the facilities to do so are
suggested in <a href="#did-controller"></a>.
        </li>

        <li>
Not all <a>DID method</a> specifications will recognize control from <a>DIDs</a>
registered using other <a>DID methods</a> and they might restrict third-party
control to <a>DIDs</a> that use the same method.
        </li>

        <li>
Access control and recovery in a <a>DID method</a> specification can also
include a time lock feature to protect against key compromise by maintaining a
second track of control for recovery.
        </li>

        <li>
There are currently no common recovery mechanisms that apply to all
<a>DID methods</a>.

      <h2>The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers</h2>

      <p>
<a>DIDs</a> achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central
registration authority. This comes at the cost of human memorability.
Algorithms capable of generating globally unambiguous identifiers
produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This
trade-off is often referred to as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko's
Triangle</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
There are use cases where it is desirable to discover a <a>DID</a> when
starting from a human-friendly identifier. For example, a natural language
name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a <a>DID controller</a>,
such as a mobile telephone number, email address, social media username, or
blog URL. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to
<a>DIDs</a>, and doing so in a way that can be verified and trusted, is
outside the scope of this specification.
      </p>

      <p>
Solutions to this problem are defined in separate specifications, such as
[[?DNS-DID]], that reference this specification. It is strongly recommended that
such specifications carefully consider the:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly
identifier for a target entity.
        </li>
        <li>
Privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently
correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DIDs as Enhanced URNs</h2>

      <p>
If desired by a <a>DID controller</a>, a <a>DID</a> or a <a>DID URL</a> is
capable of acting as persistent, location-independent resource identifier.
These sorts of identifiers
are classified as Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and are defined in [[RFC8141]].
<a>DIDs</a> are an enhanced form of URN that provide a
cryptographically secure, location-independent identifier for a digital
resource, while also providing metadata that enables retrieval. Due to the
indirection between the <a>DID document</a> and the <a>DID</a> itself, the
<a>DID controller</a> can adjust the actual location of the resource &mdash; or
even provide the resource directly &mdash; without adjusting the <a>DID</a>.
<a>DIDs</a> of this type can definitively verify that the resource retrieved is,
in fact, the resource identified.
      </p>
      <p>
A <a>DID controller</a> who intends to use a <a>DID</a> for this purpose is
advised to follow the security considerations in [[RFC8141]]. In particular:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
The <a>DID controller</a> is expected to choose a <a>DID method</a> that
supports the controller's requirements for persistence. The Decentralized
Characteristics Rubric [[?DID-RUBRIC]] is one tool available to help
implementers decide upon the most suitable <a>DID method</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>DID controller</a> is expected to publish its operational policies so
requesting parties can determine the degree to which they can rely on the
persistence of a <a>DID</a> controlled by that <a>DID controller</a>. In the
absence of such policies, requesting parties are not expected to make any
assumption about whether a <a>DID</a> is a persistent identifier for the same
<a>DID subject</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Immutability</h2>

      <p>
Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and the
assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Immutability of <a>DID documents</a>
can provide some security benefits. Individual <a>DID methods</a> ought to
consider constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics they do not
need. The more <em>locked down</em> a <a>DID method</a> is, while providing the
same set of features, the less it can be manipulated by malicious actors.
      </p>
      <p>
As an example, consider that a single edit to a <a>DID document</a> can change
anything except the root <code><a>id</a></code> property of the document. But
is it actually desirable for a <a>service</a> to change its
<code>type</code> after it is defined? Or for a key to change its value? Or
would it be better to require a new <code><a>id</a></code> when certain
fundamental properties of an object change? Malicious takeovers of a website
often aim for an outcome where the site keeps its host name identifier,
but is subtly changed underneath. If certain properties of the site, such
as the <a target="_blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">ASN</a>
associated with its IP address, were required by the specification to be
immutable, anomaly detection would be easier, and attacks would be much
harder and more expensive to carry out.
      </p>
      <p>
For <a>DID methods</a> tied to a global source of truth, a direct,
just-in-time lookup of the latest version of a <a>DID document</a> is always
possible. However, it seems likely that layers of cache might eventually sit
between a <a>DID resolver</a> and that source of truth. If they do, believing
the attributes of an object in the <a>DID document</a> to have a given state
when they are actually subtly different might invite exploits. This is
particularly true if some lookups are of a full <a>DID document</a>, and
others are of partial data where the larger context is assumed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Encrypted Data in DID Documents</h2>
      <p>
Encryption algorithms have been known to fail due to advances in cryptography
and computing power. Implementers are advised to assume that any encrypted data
placed in a <a>DID document</a> might eventually be made available in clear text
to the same audience to which the encrypted data is available. This is
particularly pertinent if the <a>DID document</a> is public.
      </p>
      <p>
Encrypting all or parts of a <a>DID document</a> is <em>not</em> an appropriate
means to protect data in the long term. Similarly, placing encrypted data in
a <a>DID document</a> is not an appropriate means to protect personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
Given the caveats above, if encrypted data is included in a <a>DID document</a>,
implementers are advised to not associate any correlatable information
that could be used to infer a relationship between the encrypted data
and an associated party. Examples of correlatable information include
public keys of a receiving party, identifiers to digital assets known to be
under the control of a receiving party, or human readable descriptions of a
receiving party.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Equivalence Properties</h2>
      <p>
Given the <code><a>equivalentId</a></code> and <code><a>canonicalId</a></code>
properties are generated by <a>DID methods</a> themselves, the same security and
accuracy guarantees that apply to the resolved <a>DID</a> present in the
<code>id</code> field of a <a>DID document</a> also apply to these properties.
The <code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> property is not guaranteed to be an accurate
statement of equivalence, and should not be relied upon without performing
validation steps beyond the resolution of the <a>DID document</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
The <code><a>equivalentId</a></code> and <code><a>canonicalId</a></code>
properties express equivalence assertions to variants of a single <a>DID</a>
produced by the same <a>DID method</a> and can be trusted to the extent the
requesting party trusts the <a>DID method</a> and a conforming producer and
resolver.
      </p>
      <p>
The <code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> property permits an equivalence assertion to
<a>URIs</a> that are not governed by the same <a>DID method</a> and cannot be
trusted without performing verification steps outside of the governing <a>DID
method</a>. See additional guidance in <a href="#also-known-as"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
As with any other security-related properties in the <a>DID document</a>,
parties relying on any equivalence statement in a <a>DID document</a> should
guard against the values of these properties being substituted by an attacker
after the proper verification has been performed. Any write access to a <a>DID
document</a> stored in memory or disk after verification has been performed is
an attack vector that might circumvent verification unless the <a>DID
document</a> is re-verified.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Content Integrity Protection</h2>
      <p>
<a>DID documents</a> which include links to external machine-readable content
such as images, web pages, or schemas are vulnerable to tampering. It is
strongly advised that external links are integrity protected using solutions
such as a hashlink [[?HASHLINK]]. External links are to be avoided if they
cannot be integrity protected and the <a>DID document</a>'s integrity is
dependent on the external link.
      </p>
      <p>
One example of an external link where the integrity of the <a>DID document</a>
itself could be affected is the JSON-LD Context [[JSON-LD11]]. To protect
against compromise, <a>DID document</a> consumers are advised to cache local
static copies of JSON-LD contexts and/or verify the integrity of external
contexts against a cryptographic hash that is known to be associated with a safe
version of the external JSON-LD Context.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Persistence</h2>
      <p>
<a>DIDs</a> are designed to be persistent such that a <a>controller</a> need not
rely upon a single trusted third party or administrator to maintain their
identifiers. In an ideal case, no administrator can take control away from the
<a>controller</a>, nor can an administrator prevent their identifiers' use for
any particular purpose such as authentication, authorization, and attestation.
No third party can act on behalf of a <a>controller</a> to remove or render
inoperable an entity's identifier without the <a>controller</a>'s consent.
      </p>
      <p>
However, it is important to note that in all <a>DID methods</a> that enable
cryptographic proof-of-control, the means of proving control can always be
transferred to another party by transferring the secret cryptographic material.
Therefore, it is vital that systems relying on the persistence of an identifier
over time regularly check to ensure that the identifier is, in fact, still under
the control of the intended party.
      </p>
      <p>
Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine from the cryptography alone whether
or not the secret cryptographic material associated with a given
<a>verification method</a> has been compromised. It might well be that the
expected <a>controller</a> still has access to the secret cryptographic material
&mdash; and as such can execute a proof-of-control as part of a verification
process &mdash; while at the same time, a bad actor also has access to those
same keys, or to a copy thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
As such, cryptographic proof-of-control is expected to only be used as one
factor in evaluating the level of identity assurance required for high-stakes
scenarios. <a>DID</a>-based authentication provides much greater assurance than
a username and password, thanks to the ability to determine control over a
cryptographic secret without transmitting that secret between systems. However,
it is not infallible. Scenarios that involve sensitive, high value, or
life-critical operations are expected to use additional factors as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
In addition to potential ambiguity from use by different <a>controllers</a>, it
is impossible to guarantee, in general, that a given <a>DID</a> is being used in
reference to the same subject at any given point in time. It is technically
possible for the controller to reuse a <a>DID</a> for different subjects and,
more subtly, for the precise definition of the subject to either change over
time or be misunderstood.
      </p>
      <p>
For example, consider a <a>DID</a> used for a sole proprietorship, receiving
various credentials used for financial transactions. To the <a>controller</a>,
that identifier referred to the business. As the business grows, it eventually
gets incorporated as a Limited Liability Company. The <a>controller</a>
continues using that same <a>DID</a>, because to <strong>them</strong> the
<a>DID</a> refers to the business. However, to the state, the tax authority, and
the local municipality, the <a>DID</a> no longer refers to the same entity.
Whether or not the subtle shift in meaning matters to a credit provider or
supplier is necessarily up to them to decide. In many cases, as long as the
bills get paid and collections can be enforced, the shift is immaterial.
      </p>
      <p>
Due to these potential ambiguities, <a>DIDs</a> are to be considered valid
<em>contextually</em> rather than absolutely. Their persistence does not imply
that they refer to the exact same subject, nor that they are under the control
of the same <a>controller</a>. Instead, one needs to understand the context in
which the <a>DID</a> was created, how it is used, and consider the likely shifts
in their meaning, and adopt procedures and policies to address both potential
and inevitable semantic drift.

      <h2>Level of Assurance</h2>

      <p>
Additional information about the security context of authentication events is
often required for compliance reasons, especially in regulated areas such as the
financial and public sectors. This information is often referred to as a Level
of Assurance (LOA). Examples include the protection of secret cryptographic
material, the identity proofing process, and the form-factor of the
authenticator.
      </p>

      </p>

Some regulated scenarios require the implementation of a specific level of
assurance. Since <a>verification relationships</a> such as <code>
<a>assertionMethod</a></code> and <code><a>authentication</a></code> might be
used in some of these situations, information about the applied security context
might need to be expressed and provided to a <em>verifier</em>. Whether and how
to encode this information in the <a>DID document</a> data model is out of scope
for this specification. Interested readers might note that 1) the information
could be transmitted using Verifiable Credentials [[?VC-DATA-MODEL]], and 2) the
<a>DID document</a> data model can be extended to incorporate this information
as described in <a href="#extensibility"></a>, and where <a

      <h2>Evaluating Competing Considerations</h2>

      <p>
This specification does not require or suggest the use of any specific type of
<a>verifiable data registry</a>. Different use cases might result in different
requirements. Different requirements might suggest different considerations with different
trade-offs. For example, trade-offs between computation (energy usage), trust
(deference to authority), coordination (network bandwidth), or memory (physical
storage) might or might not be appropriate for any given use case. Other use cases
might not make the same trade-offs. Those that need to consider different criteria
for their use case are directed to the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/">DID Method Rubric</a>, which provides

    <h1>Privacy Considerations</h1>

    <p>
Since <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> are designed to be administered
directly by the <a>DID controller(s)</a>, it is critically important to apply
the principles of Privacy by Design [[PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN]] to all aspects of the
<a>decentralized identifier</a> architecture. All seven of these principles
have been applied throughout the development of this specification. The design
used in this specification does not assume that there is a registrar, hosting
company, nor other intermediate service provider to recommend or apply
additional privacy safeguards. Privacy in this specification is preventive,
not remedial, and is an embedded default. The following sections cover privacy
considerations that implementers might find useful when building systems that
utilize <a>decentralized identifiers</a>.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Keep Personal Data Private</h2>

      <p>
If a <a>DID method</a> specification is written for a public-facing
<a>verifiable data registry</a> where corresponding <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID
documents</a> might be made publicly available, it is <em>critical</em> that
those <a>DID documents</a> contain no personal data. Personal data can instead
be transmitted through other means such as 1) Verifiable Credentials
[[?VC-DATA-MODEL]], or 2) <a>service endpoints</a> under control of the <a>DID
subject</a> or <a>DID controller</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
Due diligence is expected to be taken around the use of URLs in <a>service
endpoints</a> to prevent leakage of personal data or correlation within a URL of
a <a>service endpoint</a>. For example, a URL that contains a username is
dangerous to include in a <a>DID Document</a> because the username is likely to
be human-meaningful in a way that can reveal information that the <a>DID
subject</a> did not consent to sharing. With the privacy architecture suggested
by this specification, personal data can be exchanged on a private, peer-to-peer
basis using communication channels identified and secured by <a>verification
methods</a> in <a>DID documents</a>. This also enables <a>DID subjects</a> and
requesting parties to implement the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">right to be
forgotten</a>, because no personal data is written to an immutable
<a>distributed ledger</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DID Correlation Risks</h2>

      <p>
Like any type of globally unambiguous identifier, <a>DIDs</a> might be used for
correlation. <a>DID controllers</a> can mitigate this privacy risk by using
pairwise <a>DIDs</a> that are unique to each relationship; in effect, each
<a>DID</a> acts as a pseudonym. A pairwise <a>DID</a> need only be shared with
more than one party when correlation is explicitly desired. If pairwise
<a>DIDs</a> are the default, then the only need to publish a <a>DID</a> openly,
or to share it with multiple parties, is when the <a
href="#dfn-did-controllers">DID controller(s)</a> and/or <a>DID subject</a>
explicitly desires public identification and correlation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DID Document Correlation Risks</h2>

      <p>
The anti-correlation protections of pairwise <a>DIDs</a> are easily defeated if
the data in the corresponding <a>DID documents</a> can be correlated. For
example, using identical <a>verification methods</a> or bespoke <a>service
endpoints</a> in multiple <a>DID documents</a> can provide as much correlation
information as using the same <a>DID</a>. Therefore, the <a>DID document</a> for
a pairwise <a>DID</a> also needs to use pairwise unique information, such as
ensuring that <a>verification methods</a> are unique to the pairwise
relationship.
      </p>

      <p>
It might seem natural to also use pairwise unique <a>service endpoints</a> in
the <a>DID document</a> for a pairwise <a>DID</a>. However, unique endpoints
allow all traffic between two <a>DIDs</a> to be isolated perfectly into unique
buckets, where timing correlation and similar analysis is easy. Therefore, a
better strategy for endpoint privacy might be to share an endpoint among a large
number of <a>DIDs</a> controlled by many different subjects (see <a
href="#herd-privacy"></a>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DID Subject Classification</h2>
      <p>
It is dangerous to add properties to the <a>DID document</a> that can be used
to indicate, explicitly or through inference, what <em>type</em> or nature of
thing the <a>DID subject</a> is, particularly if the <a>DID subject</a> is a
person.
      </p>
      <p>
Not only do such properties potentially result in personal data (see
<a href="#keep-personal-data-private"></a>) or
correlatable data (see <a href="#did-correlation-risks">
</a> and <a href="#did-document-correlation-risks"></a>) being present in the
<a>DID document</a>, but they can be used for grouping particular <a>DIDs</a>
in such a way that they are included in or excluded from certain operations or
functionalities.
      </p>
      <p>
Including <em>type</em> information in a <a>DID Document</a> can
result in personal privacy harms even for <a>DID Subjects</a> that are
non-person entities, such as IoT devices. The aggregation of such
information around a <a>DID Controller</a> could serve as a form of
digital fingerprint and this is best avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
To minimize these risks, all properties in a <a>DID document</a> ought to be
for expressing cryptographic material, endpoints, or <a>verification methods</a>
related to using the <a>DID</a>.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Herd Privacy</h2>

      <p>
When a <a>DID subject</a> is indistinguishable from others in the herd,
privacy is available. When the act of engaging privately with another party is
by itself a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID
methods</a> need to work to improve herd privacy, particularly for those who
legitimately need it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces that
default to preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. To reduce <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">digital
fingerprints</a>, share common settings across requesting party
implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum on wire protocols, use
encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to standard lengths.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Service Privacy</h2>
      <p>
The ability for a <a>controller</a> to optionally express at least one
<a>service endpoint</a> in the <a>DID document</a> increases their control and
agency. Each additional endpoint in the <a>DID document</a> adds privacy risk
either due to correlation, such as across endpoint descriptions, or because the
<a>services</a> are not protected by an authorization mechanism, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DID documents</a> are often public and, since they are standardized, will be
stored and indexed efficiently by their very standards-based nature. This risk
is worse if <a>DID documents</a> are published to immutable <a>verifiable data
registries</a>. Access to a history of the <a>DID documents</a> referenced by a
<a>DID</a> represents a form of traffic analysis made more efficient through the
use of standards.
      </p>
      <p>
The degree of additional privacy risk caused by using multiple <a>service
endpoints</a> in one <a>DID document</a> can be difficult to estimate. Privacy
harms are typically unintended consequences. <a>DIDs</a> can refer to documents,
<a>services</a>, schemas, and other things that might be associated with
individual people, households, clubs, and employers &mdash; and correlation of
their <a>service endpoints</a> could become a powerful surveillance and
inference tool. An example of this potential harm can be seen when multiple
common country-level top level domains such as
<code>https://example.co.uk</code> might be used to infer the approximate
location of the <a>DID subject</a> with a greater degree of probability.
      </p>

      <section class="notoc">
        <h3>Maintaining Herd Privacy</h3>
        <p>
The variety of possible endpoints makes it particularly challenging to maintain
herd privacy, in which no information about the <a>DID subject</a> is leaked
(see <a href="#herd-privacy"></a>).
        </p>

        <p>
First, because service endpoints might be specified as <a>URIs</a>, they could
unintentionally leak personal information because of the architecture of the
service. For example, a service endpoint of
<code>http://example.com/MyFirstName</code> is leaking the term
<code>MyFirstName</code> to everyone who can access the <a>DID document</a>.
When linking to legacy systems, this is an unavoidable risk, and care is
expected to be taken in such cases. This specification encourages new,
<a>DID</a>-aware endpoints to use nothing more than the <a>DID</a> itself for
any identification necessary. For example, if a service description were to
include <code>http://example.com/did%3Aexample%3Aabc123</code>, no harm would be
done because <code>did:example:abc123</code> is already exposed in the DID
Document; it leaks no additional information.
        </p>

        <p>
Second, because a <a>DID document</a> can list multiple service endpoints, it is
possible to irreversibly associate services that are not associated in any other
context. This correlation on its own may lead to privacy harms by revealing
information about the <a>DID subject</a>, even if the <a>URIs</a> used did not
contain any sensitive information.
        </p>
        <p>
Third, because some types of <a>DID subjects</a> might be more or less likely to
list specific endpoints, the listing of a given service could, by itself, leak
information that can be used to infer something about the <a>DID subject</a>.
For example, a <a>DID</a> for an automobile might include a pointer to a public
title record at the Department of Motor Vehicles, while a <a>DID</a> for an
individual would not include that information.
        </p>
        <p>
It is the goal of herd privacy to ensure that the nature of specific <a>DID
subjects</a> is obscured by the population of the whole. To maximize herd
privacy, implementers need to rely on one &mdash; and only one &mdash; service
endpoint, with that endpoint providing a proxy or mediator service that the
controller is willing to depend on, to protect such associations and to blind
requests to the ultimate service.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="notoc">
        <h3>Service Endpoint Alternatives</h3>

        <p>
Given the concerns in the previous section, implementers are urged to
consider any of the following service endpoint approaches:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Negotiator Endpoint</strong> &mdash; Service for negotiating mutually
agreeable communications channels, preferably using private set intersection.
The output of negotiation is a communication channel and whatever credentials
might be needed to access it.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Tor Endpoint</strong> (<a
href="https://www.torproject.org/about/history/">Tor Onion Router</a>) &mdash;
Provide a privacy-respecting address for reaching service endpoints. Any service
that can be provided online can be provided through TOR for additional
privacy.
           </li>
           <li>
<strong>Mediator Endpoint</strong> &mdash; <a
href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/720bdab50e2d0437fda03028c1b17c69781bdd69/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays/README.md">Mediators</a>
provide a generic endpoint, for multiple parties, receive encrypted messages on
behalf of those parties, and forward them to the intended recipient. This avoids
the need to have a specific endpoint per subject, which could create a
correlation risk. This approach is also called a proxy.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Confidential Storage</strong> &mdash; Proprietary or confidential
personal information might need to be kept off of a <a>verifiable data
registry</a> to provide additional privacy and/or security guarantees,
especially for those <a>DID methods</a> where <a>DID documents</a> are published
on a public ledger. Pointing to external resource services provides a means for
authorization checks and deletion.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Polymorphic Proxy</strong> &mdash; A proxy endpoint that can act as any
number of services, depending on how it is called. For example, the same URL
could be used for both negotiator and mediator functions, depending on a
mechanism for re-routing.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
These service endpoint types continue to be an area of innovation and
exploration.

      <h2>Creation of a DID</h2>
      <p>
The creation of a <a>DID</a> is a process that is defined by each <a>DID
Method</a>. Some <a>DID Methods</a>, such as <code>did:key</code>, are purely
generative, such that a <a>DID</a> and a <a>DID document</a> are generated by
transforming a single piece of cryptographic material into a conformant
<a>representation</a>. Other <a>DID methods</a> might require the use of a
<a>verifiable data registry</a>, where the <a>DID</a> and <a>DID document</a>
are recognized to exist by third parties only when the registration has been
completed, as defined by the respective <a>DID method</a>. Other processes
might be defined by the respective <a>DID method</a>.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Determining the DID subject</h2>
      <p>

A <a>DID</a> is a specific type of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), so a
<a>DID</a> can refer to any resource. Per [[RFC3986]]:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
the term "resource" is used in a general sense for whatever might be
identified by a URI. [...] A resource is not necessarily
accessible via the Internet.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
Resources can be digital or physical, abstract or concrete. Any resource that
can be assigned a URI can be assigned a <a>DID</a>. The resource referred to
by the <a>DID</a> is the <a>DID subject</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
The <a>DID controller</a> determines the <a>DID subject</a>.
It is not expected to be possible to determine the <a>DID subject</a>
from looking at the <a>DID</a> itself, as <a>DIDs</a> are generally
only meaningful to machines, not human. A <a>DID</a> is unlikely to contain
any information about the <a>DID subject</a>, so further information
about the <a>DID subject</a> is only discoverable by resolving the <a>DID</a>
to the <a>DID document</a>, obtaining a verifiable credential about the
<a>DID</a>, or via some other description of the <a>DID</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
While the value of the <code><a>id</a></code> property in the retrieved
<a>DID document</a> must always match the <a>DID</a> being resolved, whether
or not the actual resource to which the <a>DID</a> refers can change over time
is dependent upon the <a>DID method</a>. For example, a <a>DID method</a>
that permits the <a>DID subject</a> to change could be used to generate a
<a>DID</a> for the current occupant of a particular role&mdash;such as the CEO
of a company&mdash;where the actual person occupying the role can be different
depending on when the <a>DID</a> is resolved.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Referring to the DID document</h2>
      <p>
The <a>DID</a> refers to the <a>DID subject</a> and <em>resolves to</em> the
<a>DID document</a> (by following the protocol specified by the
<a>DID method</a>). The <a>DID document</a> is not a separate resource from
the <a>DID subject</a> and does not have a <a>URI</a> separate from the
<a>DID</a>. Rather the <a>DID document</a> is an artifact of <a>DID
resolution</a> controlled by the <a>DID controller</a> for the purpose of
describing the <a>DID subject</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
This distinction is illustrated by the graph model shown below.

Two filled black circles appear at the top of the diagram, one on the left,
labeled "DID Controller", and one on the right, labeled "DID Subject". A
rectangle, with lower right corner bent inwards to form a small triangle,
appears below, containing the label "DID Document". Arrows extend between these
three items, as follows. A solid red arrow points directly from the DID
Controller circle, rightwards to the DID Subject circle, labeled "DID" above it
in large font, and "Identifies" below it in small italic font. The other arrow
labels are also in small italic font. A dotted red arrow, labeled "Resolves
to", extends from DID Controller, starting in the same line as the first arrow,
then curving downward to point to the DID Document rectangle. A green arrow,
labeled "Controls", points directly from DID Controller to DID Document. A
green arrow labeled "Controller" points in the opposite direction, from DID
Document to DID Controller, making an arc outward to the left of the diagram. A
blue arrow, labeled, "Describes" points directly from DID Document to DID
Subject.

      <h2>Statements in the DID document</h2>
      <p>
Each property in a <a>DID document</a> is a statement by the
<a>DID controller</a> that describes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
The string of characters defining identifiers for the <a>DID subject</a>
(e.g., the <code><a>id</a></code> and <code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code>
properties)
        </li>
        <li>
How to interact with the <a>DID subject</a> (e.g., the
<code><a>verificationMethod</a></code> and <code><a>service</a></code>
properties).
        </li>
        <li>
How to interpret the specific representation of the <a>DID document</a>
(e.g., the <code>@context</code> property for a JSON-LD representation).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
The only required property in a <a>DID document</a> is <code><a>id</a></code>,
so that is the only statement guaranteed to be in a <a>DID document</a>.

      <h2>Discovering more information about the DID subject</h2>
      <p>
Options for discovering more information about the <a>DID subject</a> depend
on the properties present in the <a>DID document</a>. If the
<code><a>service</a></code> property is present, more information can be
requested from a <a>service endpoint</a>. For example, by querying a
<a>service endpoint</a> that supports verifiable credentials for one or more
claims (attributes) describing the <a>DID subject</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
Another option is to use the <code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> property if it
is present in the <a>DID document</a>. The <a>DID controller</a> can use it
to provide a list of other URIs (including other <a>DIDs</a>) that refer to
the same <a>DID subject</a>. Resolving or dereferencing these URIs might yield
other descriptions or representations of the <a>DID subject</a> as
illustrated in the figure below.

The diagram contains three small black filled circles, two rectangles with bent

its label, is two lines of code: "alsoKnownAs: [", and "URI]". A black arrow
extends from the second line, to the right, crossing the rectangle border,
pointing to the unlabeled circle at the right of the diagram. This arrow is

extends from Description, arcing on the right, pointing up to DID Subject. A
blue arrow, also labeled "Describes", points directly from the rectangle,

down to the unlabeled circle. A red arrow, labeled "DID" above it in large font,

from DID Controller to DID Subject. A dotted red line starts in the same place
but branches off and curves downward to point to the DID Document rectangle at

      <h2>Serving a representation of the DID subject</h2>
      <p>
If the <a>DID subject</a> is a digital resource that can be retrieved
from the internet, a <a>DID method</a> can choose to construct a <a>DID URL</a>
which returns a representation of the <a>DID subject</a> itself. For example,
a data schema that needs a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier
could be assigned a <a>DID</a>, and passing a specified DID parameter (see
<a href="#did-parameters"></a>) could be used as a standard way to retrieve a
representation of that schema.
      </p>
      <p>
Similarly, a <a>DID</a> can be used to refer to a digital resource (such as
an image) that can be returned directly from a <a>verifiable data registry</a>
if that functionality is supported by the applicable <a>DID method</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Assigning DIDs to existing web resources</h2>
      <p>
If the controller of a web page or any other web resource wants to
assign it a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier, the
controller can give it a <a>DID</a>. For example, the author of a blog
hosted by a blog hosting company (under that hosting company's domain)
could create a <a>DID</a> for the blog. In the <a>DID document</a>, the
author can include the <code><a>alsoKnownAs</a></code> property pointing to
the current URL of the blog, e.g.:
      </p>
      <code>
        "alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.blogging-host.example/home"]
      </code>
      <p>
If the author subsequently moves the blog to a different hosting company
(or to the author's own domain), the author can update the <a>DID document</a>
to point to the new URL for the blog, e.g.:
      </p>
      <code>
        "alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.example/"]
      </code>
      <p>
The <a>DID</a> effectively adds a layer of indirection for the blog URL. This
layer of indirection is under the control of the author instead of under the
control of an external administrative authority such as the blog hosting
company. This is how a <a>DID</a> can effectively function as an enhanced <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141">URN (Uniform Resource
Name)</a>&mdash;a persistent identifier for an information resource whose
network location might change over time.

      <h2>The relationship between DID controllers and DID subjects</h2>
      <p>
To avoid confusion, it is helpful to classify
<a>DID subject</a>s into two disjoint sets based on their relationship to
the <a>DID controller</a>.
      </p>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Set #1: The DID subject <em>is</em> the DID controller</h3>
        <p>
The first case, shown in <a href="#controller-subject-equivalence"></a>, is
the common scenario where the <a>DID subject</a> is also the <a>DID
controller</a>. This is the case when an individual or organization creates a
<a>DID</a> to self-identify.

Two small black circles appear in the diagram, one on the upper left, labeled,
"DID Controller", and one on the upper right, labeled "DID Subject". A solid red
arrow extends from the DID Controller circle to the DID Subject circle, labeled
"DID" in large bold text above the arrow, and "Identifies" in small italic text
beneath the arrow. A dotted red double-ended arrow, labeled "Equivalence",
extends between the two circles, forming an arc in the space between and above
them. In the lower part of the diagram is a rectangle with bent corner, outlined
in black, containing the label "DID Document". Arrows point between this DID
Document rectangle and the small black circles for DID Controller and DID
Subject, with italic labels, as follows. A blue arrow points from the DID
Document to the DID Subject, labeled, "Describes". A green arrow points from the
DID Controller to the DID Document, labeled "Controls". A green arrow points
from the DID Document to the DID Controller, in an outward arc, labeled,
"Controller". A dotted red arrow, labeled "Resolves to", extends from the DID
controller starting to the right, branching off from the arrow to the DID
Subject, then curving downward to point to the DID Document.
        </div>
        <p>
From a graph model perspective, even though the nodes identified as the
<a>DID controller</a> and <a>DID subject</a> in
<a href="#controller-subject-equivalence"></a> are distinct, there is a
logical arc connecting them to express a semantic equivalence relationship.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Set #2: The DID subject is <em>not</em> the DID controller</h3>
        <p>
The second case is when the <a>DID subject</a> is a separate entity from the
<a>DID controller</a>. This is the case when, for example, a parent creates
and maintains control of a <a>DID</a> for a child; a corporation creates and
maintains control of a <a>DID</a> for a subsidiary; or a manufacturer
creates and maintains control of a <a>DID</a> for a product, an IoT device,
or a digital file.
        </p>
        <p>
From a graph model perspective, the only difference from Set 1 that there is
no equivalence arc relationship between the <a>DID subject</a> and
<a>DID controller</a> nodes.

In this case, each of the <a>DID controllers</a> might act on its own, i.e.,

a graph model perspective, in this configuration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
Each additional <a>DID controller</a> is another distinct graph node
(which might be identified by its own <a>DID</a>).

        <h3>Group Control</h3>
        <p>
In the case of group control, the <a>DID controllers</a> are expected to act
together in some fashion, such as when using a cryptographic algorithm that
requires multiple digital signatures ("multi-sig") or a threshold number of
digital signatures ("m-of-n"). From a functional standpoint, this option is
similar to a single <a>DID controller</a> because, although each of the
<a>DID controllers</a> in the <a>DID controller</a> group has its own graph
node, the actual control collapses into a single logical graph node
representing the <a>DID controller</a> group as shown in
<a href="#group-did-controllers"></a>.

On the left are three black filled circles, labeled "DID Controller Group" by a

the center right. These three arrows converge towards a single filled white

right to a rectangle shaped like a page with a curled corner, labeled "DID

      <h2>Changing the DID subject</h2>
      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> has exactly one <a>DID</a> which refers to
the <a>DID subject</a>. The <a>DID</a> is expressed as the value of the
<code><a>id</a></code> property. This property value is immutable for
the lifetime of the
<a>DID document</a>.

      <p>
However, it is possible that the resource <em>identified</em> by the <a>DID</a>,
the <a>DID subject</a>, may change over time. This is under the exclusive

      <h2>Changing the DID controller</h2>
      <p>
The <a>DID controller</a> for a <a>DID document</a> might change over time.
However, depending on how it is implemented, a change in the <a>DID
controller</a> might not be made apparent by changes to the <a>DID document</a>
itself. For example, if the change is implemented through a shift in ownership
of the underlying cryptographic keys or other controls used for one or more of
the <a>verification methods</a> in the <a>DID document</a>, it might be
indistinguishable from a standard key rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
On the other hand, if the change is implemented by changing the value of the
<a>`controller`</a> property, it will be transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
If it is important to verify a change of <a>DID controller</a>, implementers are
advised to <a>authenticate</a> the new <a>DID controller</a> against the
<a>verification methods</a> in the revised <a>DID document</a>.

In the mid-2010s, preliminary implementations of what would become Decentralized
Identifiers were <a href="https://web-payments.org/minutes/2014-05-07/#topic-1">
built</a> in collaboration with Jeremie Miller's Telehash project and the W3C
Web Payments Community Group's work led by Dave Longley and Manu Sporny. Around
a year later, the XDI.org Registry Working Group
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EP-KhH60y-nl4xkEzoeSf3DjmjLomfboF4p2umF51FA/">
began exploring</a> decentralized technologies for replacing its existing
identifier registry. Some of the first
<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">written</a>
<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot2-id2020/blob/master/final-documents/requirements-for-dids.pdf">papers</a>
exploring the concept of Decentralized Identifiers can be traced back to the
first several Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops convened by Christopher
Allen. That work led to a key collaboration between Christopher Allen, Drummond
Reed, Les Chasen, Manu Sporny, and Anil John. Anil saw promise in the technology
and allocated the initial set of government funding to explore the space.
Without the support of Anil John and his guidance through the years, it is
unlikely that Decentralized Identifiers would be where they are today. Further
refinement at the Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops led to the <a
href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/did-implementer-draft-10.pdf">first
implementers documentation</a>, edited by Drummond Reed, Les Chasen, Christopher
Allen, and Ryan Grant. Contributors included Manu Sporny, Dave Longley, Jason
Law, Daniel Hardman, Markus Sabadello, Christian Lundkvist, and Jonathan
Endersby. This initial work was then merged into the W3C Credentials Community
Group, incubated further, and then transitioned to the W3C Decentralized
Identifiers Working Group for global standardization.

      <h2>application/did+ld+json</h2>

      <p class="note" title="IETF Structured Media Types">
The Candidate Recommendation phase for this specification received a significant
number of implementations for the <code>application/did+ld+json</code> media
type. Registration of the media type <code>application/did+ld+json</code> at
IANA is pending resolution of the <a
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-w3cdidwg-media-types-with-multiple-suffixes">
Media Types with Multiple Suffixes</a> issue. Work is expected to continue in
the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mediaman/about/">IETF Media Type
Maintenance Working Group</a> with a registration of the
<code>application/did+ld+json</code> media type by W3C following shortly after
the publication of the <a
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-w3cdidwg-media-types-with-multiple-suffixes">
Media Types with Multiple Suffixes</a> RFC.
